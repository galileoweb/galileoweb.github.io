				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>This year we  awarded 8 grants totaling $4,150.</b></p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Allison Wagner: English Teacher</b></p>
<p><b><i>2 class sets of <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Alchemist</span>  &#8211; $500</i></b></p>
<p>This grant will help towards funding the purchase of two class sets of The Alchemist by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho for Ms. Wagner’s 10<sup>th</sup> grade World Literature classes. The books will be used for two classes for several years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Daniel Grimm: Chemistry Teacher Lab supplies</b></p>
<p><b><i>Chemistry  Lab Supplies &#8211; $500</i></b></p>
<p>This grant will help towards the purchase of Chemistry Lab supplies as there was no budget for any lab supplies in the 2012-2013 school budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Bai Zhen: College Counselor</b></p>
<p><b><i>Road to College Workshop, February 2013 &#8211; $300</i></b></p>
<p>This grant will be used to buy the food for the dinner provided during this evening college workshop. Information is provided for seniors and their parents in one session and all other grades in another. This workshop has become an essential part of the Galileo College Counseling program. Many parents would be deterred from coming to a 2.5 hour workshop after work, if food were not provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Robotics Club/David Barrios: Physics teacher/Sponsor</b></p>
<p><b><i>Robotics Club participation in the FIRST Robotics competition &#8211; $500</i></b></p>
<p>This grant was to be used towards the purchase of supplies for the competition and for some of the hotel and food costs for the approximately 30 Robotics Club student members who will be attending the event held at UC Davis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Lillian Giles: English Teacher</b></p>
<p><b><i>Class Set of <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Wild Seed</span> &#8211; $500</i></b></p>
<p>The grant will help purchase a class set of  <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Wild Seed</span> by Octavia Butler to be used by 2 sections of 11<sup>th</sup> Grade American Literature for several years.</p>

<p><b>Cassandra Gamm: Physics Teacher</b></p>
<p><b><i>7 Vernier Labquests &#8211; $1286  (as approved by the PTSA at a General meeting)</i></b></p>
<p>This grant was matched by the Galileo Alumni Committee and aided in the purchase of 7 Labquest sensors and a charger for the Science department.  Currently adopted by the Physics teachers, these instruments help take/make measurements of many kinds and are useful not only in teaching the material of the course but in preparing students to use such equipment when they go on to college. This will make it possible for more than one teacher to use a set at a time and the possibility of more availability for students to use first hand and not only in large groups. The sensors will be used for many classes for many years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Eugene Wing: ASB Advisor</b></p>
<p><b><i>Student Handbook Folders &#8211; $500</i></b></p>
<p>This grant will help towards funding the printing of the Galileo student handbook/folder which provides information about graduation requirements, attendance policy, citizenship policy, directory, clubs, school song and yells and campus map.</p>

<p><strong>Eugene Wing, Associated Student Body ( ASB) advisor</strong><em> </em><br />
<em>Leadership Conference &#8212; $500</em><br />
To help offset the cost of taking 40 students to a Leadership Conference.  These student leaders (ASB officers, class officers, club presidents and potential freshman leaders) will take leadership workshops and be involved in activities that promote involvement in student government, clubs and sports.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Roman, English teacher</strong><br />
<em>Renaissance Fair &#8212; $500</em><br />
To help pay for the entrance fees for 50 students to go to the Renaissance Fair.  Mr. Roman has been taking Senior students to the fair for the last five years but lost his funding this year so asked for PTSA help. The students will see plays and be submersed into the life and culture of the Renaissance Era in preparation for studying the works of Shakespeare.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Matsumoto, Chemistry &amp; Physics teacher, </strong><br />
<em>Physics Lab Supply &#8212; $339.92</em><br />
This grant is to purchase a power amp which will aid in developing various Physics Lab activities and a portable sound system for use in the class.</p>
<p><em>Chemistry Visualization Software&#8211; $296.68</em><br />
This software will provide an interactive environment for learning and exploration.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Colvin, Wellness Coordinator, </strong><br />
<em>Healthy Food / Snacks and Incentives &#8211;$500</em><br />
This will be used to purchase healthy food/ snacks and incentives for students who participate in Wellness programming.  One of the most effective ways that the Wellness counselors have found to outreach to students and bring them in is through different incentives, including food.   Again the center previously got funding from elsewhere but lost that funding this year so she asked the PTSA for help.</p>
