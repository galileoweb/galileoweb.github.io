<p align="right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>1/24/13</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am. Marcus distributed various documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Special Ed Inclusive Alignment</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray went to the Special Ed. district wide department head meeting yesterday.  He mentioned that Special Ed teachers must be assigned to classrooms.  He also said that Special Ed teachers cannot teach content if they do not have the subject credential.  All Special Ed students must be taught by single subject credentialed teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;John O’Connell, Burton and Aptos have already done this.  Mission and Presidio are also close to Full Inclusion.</p>
<p>&#8211;The strategic goal is 80% or more with disabilities will spend 80% or more time in regular ed. classes with appropriate support.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said this will affect the Master Schedule.  He mentioned Specialized Instruction.</p>
<p>&#8211;The planning to move the students into regular classes is happening now.  This is not a class size issue.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray mentioned his credentials and what he can and cannot teach with the new requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked about those students who could not make it in regular classes.  Ray said they will be in remedial classes, taught by remedial teachers.  These students will not get diplomas.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray mentioned combining his geometry class with Mr. Flisak’s class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;We have 20 Special Ed students that will not be integrated.  We have 160-180 Special Ed students.  Ray will give everyone the numbers for next year.  Marcus explained how the student allocation will work with Special Ed students in regular classes.  We will have fewer General Ed students to make the allocation balance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is not a specific time line to have all the requirements implemented.  Ray said at any given time, 20% of the SDC students will remain in SDC.  Changes will have to be made in elementary school.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said this whole issue is about compliance.  He gave Ray kudos for having so many Special Ed students in regular classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said those students who were not behaving well are benefiting from being in the Regular Ed classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said we have 11 Special Ed teachers who do not teach the severely impaired.</p>
<p>Ray indicated that this won’t happen by the fall.  He did say that all teachers will be team teaching.  He also said the current CPT structure will not be helpful for this new planning.</p>
<p>&#8211;How will we match up the content teachers and the Special Ed teachers?</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray ran through a series of frequently asked questions about this new program.</p>
<p>&#8211;The plan is to get all Special Ed teachers (Special Ed specialists) into the classroom full time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Leah asked where this system came from and Ray said it is nationwide.  He mentioned some states have tiered a diploma system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren said this plan changes the way students are counseled.  This has been a topic of discussion in the counseling office</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         ASB Proposed Student Activity Dates</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed a document with set dates and some proposed change of dates.</p>
<p>&#8211;Graduation has changed to May 30<sup>th</sup>, but we do not have a rehearsal date.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the district did hear us that it was not fair to hold graduation on May 31<sup>st</sup>, a furlough date.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned that some students have made flight arrangements prior to May 31<sup>st</sup>.  Janet Schulze will write a letter to the airlines.  We do not know if the airlines will honor the letter for changes in airline tickets.</p>
<p>&#8211;Move-Up Assembly proposed for 5/17—during AP testing.  Move-Up Assembly cannot be on that day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Spring 2013 Final Exam Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;We need to plan Senior Finals, Clearance and Regular Finals.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus proposed exams on Friday, May 24, Tuesday, May 28 and Wednesday, May 29 with make-ups on May 30<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said senior English teachers rely on the block periods for senior finals.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus suggested senior finals on May 22 and 23.  Lauren said that would not be enough time for clearance.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy checked the AP tests schedule for conflicts with senior finals.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed about attendance for seniors after final exams.</p>
<p>&#8211;Suggestion made to put the Aloha Festival on 5/17.</p>
<p>&#8211;Suggestion Aloha Festival and Move-up Assembly both on May 3<sup>rd</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Senior Finals will be May 15 and 16.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said grades are due by 11:15am on 5/31.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed about students who take make-up exams.</p>
<p>&#8211;Proposal made to have a doctor’s note to take a make-up exam.</p>
<p>&#8211;Finals will be Friday, May 24<sup>th</sup>, Tuesday, May 28<sup>th</sup> and Wednesday, May 29<sup>th</sup>.  This is tentative until we confirm with transportation.  Friday periods 1 and 2 exams, Tuesday, periods 4 and 6 exams, and Wednesday periods 3 and 5 exams.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle suggested changing the date of the Senior Breakfast to 5/23.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Space Allocation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus suggested we table this until the next meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said that we need to have this discussion before we do the Master Schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         CFAs</p>
<p>&#8211;The dates are May 13th and 20<sup>th</sup>.  Marcus will discuss them with everyone after they are completed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Heads Meeting</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Master Schedule</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dates for Grade:  Thursday, 2/28 at 8:00am.  Grading period ends on 2/22.</p>
<p>Friday, April 25<sup>th</sup> at 8:00am.  Grading period ends on 4/19.</p>
<p>Friday, May 31<sup>st</sup> at 11:15am.</p>
<p>NO EXCEPTIONS!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said we have our course catalogue on the web site on one page.  It will be under the tab “Counseling Office.”  Most courses have descriptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Registration will begin next Monday for 10<sup>th</sup> – 12<sup>th</sup> graders.  Counselors will use Room 104.  Goal is to complete this by 2/22/13.  If we need more space we will use 101 and 102 when Mr. Tan and Mr. Machtay have preps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy mentioned the A-G planning sheets.  She sent the group guidelines via email.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said on Tuesday night, 5:30pm – 7pm they will host a Road to College Program to inform parents about what courses their students need to take.  Parents learn from School Loop, the PTSA the auto-dialer, etc. Two hundred families usually attend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug asked Nancy to provide the student HO numbers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy will provide a calendar with all deadlines at the next meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy must be completely done with the Master Schedule by June 1<sup>st</sup> with the new system, Synergy. She has been flexible with changes in the past, but this year there will be no changes after June 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said changes in the teacher roster will require some flexibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All students, including 9<sup>th</sup> graders, and all teachers must be in place in the Master Schedule by June 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said we need better data from the Newcomer students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy suggested a Dept. Head meeting next Thursday to discuss the Master Schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;This meeting is moving to 3<sup>rd</sup> period next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Compliance issues will be a major item next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested we keep the Leadership Team/Department Head meetings on Tuesdays, meeting each week for different topics.  The group agreed so the group will meet every Tuesday during 4<sup>th</sup> period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said students can get a waiver for foreign language if they speak English as a second language.  Also, students can be exempt from PE if they are an athlete.  That can start in the Freshman year.  All Freshmen will have to take PE.  PE is optional for Sophomores if they are an athlete.  A season of a sport counts as 1 semester.  If an athlete becomes ineligible, they still can practice with the team and get credit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Sophomores can sign up for PE, JROTC, or get a waiver to be an athlete.</p>
<p>&#8211;Because of the PE and foreign language waivers, we will have some challenges to fill a 6 period day for all students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan mentioned a coach who is not certificated now can give PE credit to an athlete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:45am.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          AP Course Enrollment/New Contract</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked how we would handle the concept of open enrollment into the AP classes, given the new contract.  If the course has 25 students, the teacher is given an AP prep.  What happens if a student drops a class—does the teacher lose the AP prep?</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said she has no plans to change the 7-step process for a student to drop a class.  Nancy would not change the Master Schedule if a student drops the class.  Marcus said the AP preps will stay as they are in place at the beginning of the school year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked if the district would do an audit during the year.</p>
<p>&#8211;As of right now, with 25 students in an AP class, the teacher will get an AP prep.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said that they would talk to the district if an audit proceeds.</p>
<p>&#8211;At the semester, students could leave an AP class only if they are failing or getting a D.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said his department is always over enrolled and mentioned evaluating those students who want to enroll in an AP class.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said that each department probably does this differently.  David feels this is up to the AP teacher.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug says he fits in as many students as he can that will fit in the room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked about how the counselors handle students signing up for multiple AP classes.  Lauren said they talk to the students, the parents, and they counsel them.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said last year if students had 3 or more AP or honors classes, they meet with the student to make sure the students know what they are getting into.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren suggested teachers give the counselors an idea of how many hours of homework each level has would help when the counselors talk to the students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked if we should get parental signatures for more than 3 of these classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said this year there are not as many students who are overwhelmed.  She mentioned 5 cases.</p>
<p>&#8211;David also mentioned students who do not do well in the AP classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said she needs feedback on Google registration sheets she sent to everyone by the end of finals week.</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked about course descriptions.  Nancy said it was online.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray asked about .71 Chemistry and when it will be on the item deck.</p>
<p>&#8211;Leah wanted to look at the AP Native Spanish speaker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said that freshmen will now have a choice of a VPA course or a World Language class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Winter Assembly Details</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked for clarification on 1 assembly or 2.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we plan for 2 but it will probably be 1.</p>
<p>&#8211;We will call the first group down and see how it goes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Traffic Sign for Bay Street</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen wants to keep it on the agenda until it happens.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said Katie has been making phone calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Finals Week Suggestions</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat asked if Homeroom would be Nutrition time.  Answer is Yes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Question was asked about the computer labs and homeroom.  There will be signs posted next week and the labs will only be for study.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Dress Code</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie talked about a student at the football banquet who was inappropriately dressed.  She looked in the Student Handbook and found a dress code.  She also added something from Balboa’s dress code.  Students will be sent home if they are dressed inappropriately.</p>
<p>&#8211;Please review these policies with your department.  Students can wear their PE uniforms or get clothes in the Deans’ Office.</p>
<p>&#8211;This is district policy and in the handbook.  We need to be consistent about this now and remind students.</p>
<p>&#8211;This is not something to suspend students for.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren asked if students could make up work for the time they are off campus to change.</p>
<p>&#8211;Call the Deans’ Office if you are unsure about dress or behavior.  If teachers feel uncomfortable addressing students, call the Deans.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug mentioned the past and students not wearing hats.  If there is not consistency, it will break down.  Katie said this is also a safety issue.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug would like to take this out of the teacher’s responsibility and give it to the Deans, counselors or administrators.</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison spoke about classroom rules and what the teacher’s rules are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Mandatory Lesson</p>
<p>&#8211;January 18<sup>th</sup> on Internet Safety.  Everybody has to do this.  This is funding for the state.  It will be during a specific period.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked if the video is culturally sensitive.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus will distribute copies of the directions.</p>
<p>&#8211;The state will capture the attendance for that date and period.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested we air it on G-House TV.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the TV networks not working with the change over.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said they switched from analog to digital and now each TV must have a box.  They will provide 3 boxes.  Each new box is $1.99 per month.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie will deal with Comcast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Heads </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          CLA</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed district information to apply for up to $2,000 in extended hours to work on CLAs.  Principals have been asking for compensation.  Let Lisa or Marcus know if you are interested.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus would like to see work on the CFAs and CLAs that we have been doing in English and Math.</p>
<p>&#8211;This is a project outside of the classroom.</p>
<p>&#8211;We will table this item until the next meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         CPT Calendar Spring 2013</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa thanked everyone for working with her and meeting with her.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa distributed the CPT calendar and did some highlighting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Yellow times are those each member should do the planning.  Lisa offered some suggestions.</p>
<p>&#8211;In January please let her know what you will be doing on those days—goals, activities, location, etc.  There is a share folder on Google Docs you can use.  She would like them to be all in that folder.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said this folder is a living document and members can make changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa mentioned the new grade level team meetings and how they would work.  This will be on January 10<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Balanced Score Card Data</p>
<p>&#8211;On January 16<sup>th</sup> there will be Balanced Score Card work in departments.  How do we pull out what is useful and how do we find out what is meaningful will be the topic on January 9<sup>th</sup>.  Then on the 16<sup>th</sup>, each department will be able to look at department data.  Lisa asked what each member would need to lead this meeting.</p>
<p>She mentioned needs, growths, etc.  Let Lisa know what data you want.</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked for a list of guiding questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Common Core</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said the Common Core is coming and will affect English and Math in a very extreme way, but it affects everyone across the board.</p>
<p>&#8211;The district has come up with some smart test questions they will provide.</p>
<p>&#8211;The Common Core Standards will be in effect in a year and a half—the implementation will occur at that time.</p>
<p>&#8211;She distributed one from Algebra and one from English for the group to look at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said in her department they learned that the standards have changed.  She said they looked at student work, what they are teaching, and what the standards are.  She said it was eye opening.  There are more demands from the students.  This is an elevation from what we have done in the past.  Much will depend on what the middle schools do with this and then what we do as the students enter high school.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph heard a report on MPR radio from Chicago, and it mentioned the test scores went down.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         ELL Next Steps</p>
<p>&#8211;Bissa is here for the meeting.  She spoke of the QTEL activities.  We received the Newcomer students when that school closed and we have the Lau walk through from last year.  She explained some of her activities.</p>
<p>&#8211;She asked for feedback on ways to move forward around ESL strategies.  She asked about ideas for professional development and what would be helpful.  When the IOC or Federal Government comes again, what would be helpful to move ahead?</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said the negative feedback from the past came from too much material for the time period.  It is hard to find time in CPT to do multiple presentations.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said that all the PD’s do not incorporate a math classroom.  This is frustrating for the Math teachers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Bissa is looking for ways to make things better.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said there is no discussion about language acquisition.  We have many students come with lower levels.  No discussion on how we learn language.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said folks were upset about the critique, but our scores are getting better.</p>
<p>&#8211;Leah said the model lessons they were given are geared toward the students, and not necessarily the teachers. Adult learners are not being engaged.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said that we need to start focusing on subject area groups, rather than the general sessions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned 2 years ago that we eliminated 9<sup>th</sup> grade honors.  This was supposed to be district wide.  She said there are still some 9<sup>th</sup> grade honors classes.  She asked if it is a possibility to reinstate 9<sup>th</sup> grade honors.  Nancy will look into this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug asked Nancy when she needs to know if some students cannot move on to the next Math level. She needs this information ASAP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David mentioned the Science Department budget and asked for extra funds.  He has some items that need replacing.  He also cannot send anyone to conferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;The PTSA and GAA are asking for grant applications.  Marcus said they are not getting enough applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:45am.</p>

<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed a new final exam schedule.  He explained that we were called on the carpet by the district for not having enough instructional minutes.  We will have a homeroom for 40 minutes—we will call this a “Nutritional Homeroom.”  The final exams will be 2 hours and 15 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray asked about the Special Ed busses on 3 days.  We will have them but we have to pay for them.</p>
<p>&#8211;We will talk about next year’s bell schedule at the next meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Class Observations</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked for Lisa if the teachers would be willing to have Lisa and Bissa come and observe the classes. Joseph, Doug, Kathleen, Stan, Ethan, Michelle, Mat, Leah said Yes.  Ray said No.  Mat asked if they would be notified in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Substance Abuse Assembly Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica distributed a proposed schedule for that day, March 21, 2013.</p>
<p>&#8211;The left column shows a normal Thursday schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;This schedule would eliminate Homeroom and there would be 15 minutes less in the class times.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica explained the logistics of the assembly, the discussion after the assembly and there will be time for the regular class, which will be 15 minutes shorter than the normal block period.</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison said there has been an increase in marijuana use this year so this assembly will be very beneficial.</p>
<p>&#8211;The schedule was approved by the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Academic Integrity</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison asked if there is a school wide policy concerning cheating.  She said she and Mr. Emmi are noticing periods of time during the year when cheating is prevalent.</p>
<p>&#8211;They ask the teacher for their policy and if the students know it.  They talk to the student and then have the student write a letter of apology, and a paragraph about academic integrity. Then they set up a conference with the parent, the student, the teacher, the counselor and the Dean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David said we had discussed the need for a bare minimum of what will happen if a student cheats.  All students need to know this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison asked if we need more than this and David said we definitely do need more.  He would like a teacher component added—like the student should fail that assignment.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked if the school wide policy is in addition to each teacher’s individual policy.  The levels of plagiarism in the school vary.</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison felt the Deans’ Office would put out a policy, including a 0 on an assignment where the student cheated.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said that some students may not be clear on all forms of academic dishonesty.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug also said that cheating does not necessarily happen in front of the teacher the work is for, but in front of another teacher.  Katie indicted a school wide policy would cover this.  Joseph mentioned a part of Balboa’s policy—someone who gives someone else homework to copy is just as guilty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked for the insertion of sources students use for their outside papers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen felt that there should be some education to the students about cheating.  She mentioned that students cheat on the CAHSEE exam.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said her department is having more in class writing exams due to the Internet.  They also get an initial sampling of student writing at the beginning of the year to have a benchmark for each student.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about repeat offenses.  David said that Lincoln does a really nice job in this area.  Allison said they have not had a lot of repeat offenders.  She said that the students break down and cry within 7 minutes, and they have not had repeat offenders who were caught in the last year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David suggested using Lincoln’s policy.  He would like to go through it and see if there were some things he did not agree with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren mentioned situations that are dealt with by the teacher and don’t have to go to the Dean’s Office.  Teachers should keep track of the offenses.  Katie suggested putting this information into the online referral system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison said they have only received 1 written referral this year—all the rest have been online.  David said that once teachers write a referral they can access referrals from other teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison would like to see “Deans’ Office Referral Written and Entered into Permanent Record.”  This will be of value to those students who are anxious to go to college.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie would like to have the group take this to their departments and then review with the students, particularly with finals coming up.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen suggested using SSR time to address academic honesty, perhaps with a power point presentation.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle discussed doing this as teachers give reviews for their finals.</p>
<p>&#8211;David suggested having students sign an agreement.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked how we could get this back from the students who have to get their parent’s signature</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren suggested students sign in class and return that to the teacher.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie felt that the signature does not mean much for the kids.  She felt that if the form was distributed in Homeroom, on G-House TV, and discussed in every class that would be enough.</p>
<p>&#8211;David felt that the parents need to know this information.  Katie said this is in the handbook, and that the school can suspend.</p>
<p>&#8211;It can also be published on School Loop.</p>
<p>&#8211;Let Allison know by tomorrow if you have suggestions, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug asked about transitional students and how we handle them. Discussion followed concerning the advantages and disadvantages of identifying these students to all teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said that Wellness and Counseling work with the EWI students.  EWI—Early Warning Indicator—based on attendance and GPA.  This comes from Data Director.  Transitional Student information is more comprehensive.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica said the EWI list should be shared with students.  She also suggested sending both list and saying the students on the list are either EWI or transitional, but not identify who is on what list.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said he would like to know if students he refers are placed on the lists.  Katie said Donald shares his caseload with the staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.  Update on Slow School Zone Signs</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie called 311 twice and now she put Kelli Mallen on it.  Kelli is going to the Supervisor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked about CPT. Marcus said it is on the UBC agenda today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:05am.</p>
