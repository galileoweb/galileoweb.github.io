<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 12:15pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Walk Throughs</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus spoke about the history of the Walk Through tool and how it went last year.  He mentioned that the rating portion caused some discussion last year.</p>
<p>&#8211;David suggested Marcus email the teachers after a Walk Through and ask the teachers to come in for a conversation.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he will make it clear to the staff that he enjoys the conversations and will send the staff an email if he feels there should be a conversation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa asked for the process of Informal Walk Throughs, as she will be doing much of this on an informal basis.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said that it has pretty much been that visits are welcome and there is an open door policy.  She mentioned administrators who dropped a note to the teachers after a visit.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said it is a criterion for evaluation for administrators, so this year Marcus will have to show more documentation that the administrators are doing walk throughs.  Marcus will keep a copy of the document for his records.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said he would not want this to be part of a formal evaluation and would not want this to get into his personnel files.  He said he welcomes anyone to come to his classroom to observe.  This also helps with student management.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph also said that his department members have done walk throughs in his department.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said that his department does this and does cover classes for each other so they can observe in other departments.</p>
<p>&#8211;The administrators were asked if they could help cover classes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         CLAs and Common Formative Assessments</p>
<p>&#8211;Testing window for CLAs is October 9 – 19<sup>th</sup>.  This is on the Staff Calendar.  All departments are giving some sort of assessments during this time.</p>
<p>&#8211;David mentioned that they have created a CLA for the Fall and for the Spring.  He also said that this was written for the end of the semester.  English and Math for 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> graders will happen in the October time period.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug asked about the hand written portion of the test. Lisa said she and Marcus would do some training to help teachers use the data.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked if the Common Formative Assessment has to be a scantron test.  Marcus said Joseph would have to do it by hand.  Joseph talked about his project based assignments.  Lisa suggested looking at particular sections of the rubric.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph would like to see Common Formative Assessments from other departments.  This would help in planning their test.</p>
<p>&#8211;David felt the goal of this is to see what we need to do better on.  We want to have the best use of our time.  Marcus said that some departments have activities in common while others do not.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested each department could pick their best assessment and share it with others.</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat asked if there would be another window for the non-Math/English assessments.</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat said his department did not want to do the assessment at the end of the semester, as there would not be time for changes.  Marcus will send out an email and everyone will have input for the timing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       School Loop Training</p>
<p>&#8211;Training on Thursday will include an intro class from 1:30pm-2:30pm.  The advanced training will be from 2:30pm on.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa has answers to some of the questions.</p>
<p>&#8211;By 3:30pm, everyone must have the syllabus up, send an email, post an assignment, upload a document (hopefully your syllabus), and your grading scale.</p>
<p>&#8211;Anyone who already knows how to do all of these activities does not have to go to the training, but all of these items must be posted by 3:30pm.  Two trainers will be here—one of them is the mother of one of our students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said he tried to post an assignment last night, but with no students listed it was not possible to post an assignment.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph brought up the issue of “intellectual property.”  He would like to hear from the union about this.  He feels that if he creates something on his home computer, he owns it.  Does it have to be copy writed?  There is not enough time to do all of this by 3:30pm tomorrow.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said it does not need to be the actual syllabus, but should know how to do the activity.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen feels the same as Joseph about the issue of “intellectual property.”</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said that documents do not have to be attached—just the basic assignment.  The title of the assignment would be fine.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said he felt this syllabus is his “intellectual property,” and he would like clarification from the union.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa mentioned that any work that you do on work time then becomes the property of the school/company, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he is not sure there is anything in the contract about this issue.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph felt that each individual has a right to their “intellectual property.”</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said the solution is to upload something resembling the document.  The syllabus is the document she would like uploaded.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed to change the language.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug mentioned that the Math Department would not be at school on Thursday, so Lisa will help on Friday</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        CST and Goal Setting</p>
<p>&#8211;You can look at your results, but we cannot share it until August 31<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked everyone to join a prediction activity—for the  CSTs write a prediction of what the CST will be for last year in each department. Marcus collected the predictions from each member.</p>
<p>&#8211;It was mentioned that the UCs might use CST results for English class placement.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus mentioned reading Schmoker last year and this will be an activity this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat mentioned that 6<sup>th</sup> period on Wednesday and Thursday next week would be 35 minutes, while all others are 50 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about department budgets—do we have any money?  Supplies will come out of a general area.  Katie said it was voted on last year that departments would relinquish their supplies to save a position.  Katie suggested Donor’s Choice as an alternative to get supplies, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 12:55pm</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 11:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus welcomed the new members, Lisa Warnke and Douglas Page.  Then everyone introduced themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Heads</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Department Head Return Dates</p>
<p>&#8211;At the last meeting this was under discussion.  The return date will be August 13<sup>th</sup>.  The mornings will be for everyone to work on their own and then there will be meetings in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8211;Department Heads will work 2 days prior to school and 3 days after school.</p>
<p>&#8211;It has not been determined yet if there will be department heads in the fall.  No one has received letters yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned a Grievance Meeting next Wednesday at 3pm, 555 Franklin Street, Room 306.  Joseph and Michelle are mentioned by name in a letter he read to Susan Solomon concerning all department heads.             Joseph encouraged everyone to attend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Calendar</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie mentioned that she and Tony will be working on the Galileo calendar for next year.  She asked members to give them any dates they wanted on the calendar.</p>
<p>&#8211;Freshmen Orientation will be the Friday before classes begin.  PE uniforms will be sold at that time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug Page asked for the end of the marking periods.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph wants the Winter and Spring concerts on the calendar.</p>
<p>&#8211;Date for Back to School Night should be on the calendar.</p>
<p>&#8211;September 20 or 27 will be the ELD Picnic/Team Building Activity.</p>
<p>&#8211;Human Rights Exhibit should be between STAR and AP testing.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen asked for the CELTD testing dates.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned the concept of unbalanced semesters.  In the spring semester, there is STAR testing, 4 Furlough Days and a week of finals, which he felt made this semester so rushed.  Kathleen said the first semester seemed really rushed.  Joseph felt we should eliminate the Final Exam week.  He also thought we should have 3 block days for finals, and have teachers give 1-hour finals only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David said some teachers want that time to do their grades, clean their rooms, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we want to get students ready to go to college and the finals are part of that.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said we should have a policy about finals as many do not give them.  She asked if this is a sight-based decision.</p>
<p>&#8211;The Furlough Days are not listed on the Instructional Calendar.  The district says it is 4 for next year.  If the state tax initiative does not pass, the amount of furlough days will be 9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about CPT for next year.  Marcus said we need to do the PD plan first.  We will go with the 2 days—Wednesday and Thursday.  She asked for the Cluster Time.  Doug also asked for more CPT for the clusters.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said with the Cluster Time there must be agendas with a focus and a goal.  We need to be efficient with the time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said that most teachers teach more than one subject so they are involved in 2 clusters.</p>
<p>&#8211;David had a suggestion on how to target both the admin requirements and the cluster activity and meet administrative requirements.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said he prefers the meetings to be longer than 1 hour.  The old 2 hour meetings were much more productive,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Final Survey Results</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph passed out the final survey results.</p>
<p>&#8211;Most preferred the 5-minute passing period.</p>
<p>&#8211;Most people preferred 2 homerooms per week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Most people wanted to keep 15 minutes of SSR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;The survey also included the teacher comments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David mentioned that the teachers who travel do have a challenge to get to the next classroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the student survey results were not clear.  54% preferred the 5-minute period.  We will look at the student survey and make the final decision.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked about the SSR.  David said school literacy is a huge issue.  Research shows that it is very effective in literacy.  Literacy affects all disciplines.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said students like structure.  It happens every block day for each period.  Ethan said he requires books in PE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said every classroom should have an SSR library.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa suggested having SSR during homeroom. She suggested making homeroom longer.</p>
<p>&#8211;G-House TV will continue next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said we use homeroom for class level assemblies as well.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said that Homeroom is not supposed to be an additional class for the teacher.  Joseph said this is also a union issue, so homeroom is not a class.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said homeroom is a chance to talk to the kids and homeroom stays together 4 years.  It is a bonding issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Kelli made a comment about the attendance strips and homeroom, which Joseph read to the group.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen mentioned the citizenship policy and Katie said that there are teachers who do not enforce this policy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug talked about private schools, where the teacher just marks the attendance strips and does the grades.  The absences are calculated by the school and then citizenship grades are assigned accordingly.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise talked about what the Deans’ Office puts out about citizenship.  She followed it and it worked.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said he thought many teachers might forget about doing the citizenship.</p>
<p>&#8211;New teachers may not know about the citizenship policy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus thanked Joe and Stan for doing the survey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise asked about old editions of books in boxes.  Katie said the warehouse will come and collect, but they need a list.  Put the books outside where you keep the books.  Please email Katie if you have books to get rid of and where they will be.</p>
<p>&#8211;Consumables can be recycled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen has lots of SSR books and magazines.  Katie asked her to send that out in an email in the fall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked if our entire faculty will be in place at the start of school.  He also asked about the budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said his department has their books on rollers.  Please do not take these books or carts.  The carts are labeled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we will use the entire 2<sup>nd</sup> floor for summer school, and the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor in the Van Ness Building.  Some classrooms are a mess right now and have to be cleaned prior to summer school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Promethean Boards—Marcus encouraged the group to make the best use of them.  If some teachers are not using them, give them to others in your department.  Kathleen said we need training.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat asked about tomorrow.  Marcus asked the members to stop in and see him tomorrow.  He will be here until 3pm tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:55pm.</p>

<p align="right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>5/17/12</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Balanced Score Card</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed information on the Balanced Score Card.  This is a living document.  He asked for feedback from the group.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus will get into the WASC report over the summer and see what else we need to address.</p>
<p>&#8211;We need to go into next school year knowing what we need to do.  The first two sections are over view and data review.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned the Core Curriculum the district is putting together.  She mentioned what the district is doing with the Standards Maps.  At this point we do not know what this is.  Tony referred to her page 8b.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony said the district does not have clarity about what this will look like.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said they are not using the Common Core to design the Common Curriculum for English.</p>
<p>&#8211;Part A concerns readiness and challenges.  This is followed by Next Steps.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick mentioned the lack of funds for professional development.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said they will be dropping the CLA’s next year.  He said this was mentioned in the WAD from last week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;ELD Current Status—we list what we are doing now.  Some of this is ELD department and the rest is other departments.  Language Objectives are listed as well.  We are not doing the BBC school-wide so we still have to address having a language objective in each classroom.</p>
<p>&#8211;Vocabulary development is spelled out on page 9. Brick word and mortar words are the same.</p>
<p>&#8211;Section 3 of the Lau Plan will be studied next year.  Tony mentioned some training that will occur this summer with Q-tell.  Jen Fong will help with PD next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Special Ed is the next section.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti asked about statistics on AA and Latino students.  Ray addressed this and indicated what the numbers meant.  Ray said he would explain any of the “Next Steps.”</p>
<p>&#8211;Administrators must attend the IEPs and administrators must arrange coverage for teachers who need to attend the IEPs.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray expressed the challenges of scheduling the IEPs.  He also said there is a box to excuse administrators and teachers on the IEP—full exclusion or partial, depending on which box is checked.</p>
<p>&#8211;Proportional Representation—Ray discussed this and said we have talked about this before.  For 30 students, 3 or 4 Special Ed students is the max.</p>
<p>__Michelle said this has come up before—she would like some PD on how to arrange this.  Ray said his department would be happy to do this.  Marcus said he would like to know from general ed teachers where we should start with PD.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said the teachers who are delivering resource services, they should be in the classroom, not in room 352.  It should be a 100% commitment.</p>
<p>&#8211;Some in the group said they do not feel comfortable asking the resource teachers why they can’t come to class when they say they can’t.</p>
<p>&#8211;Increased administrative monitoring of how Special Ed resources are allocated in classrooms.</p>
<p>&#8211;Resource also includes the paraprofessionals.  Ray said we have some of the best paras in the district.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said that the Inclusion model has only been pushed for the last several years.  He mentioned our new AP, Lisa Warnke, and her experience in this area.  He is happy to have her on board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Section IV</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle wants other departments listed besides English.  Marcus said this is a school-wide activity.  This has also been discussed in the SSC meetings.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we need to add more to Closing the Achievement Gap.  We are having an extremely hard time with our Latino students.  Some of the students in 9<sup>th</sup> grade are drinking, etc.  We have12% now Latino students in the 9<sup>th</sup> grade and this will double next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick mentioned conflicts of getting the dens together.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus mentioned that the English Department has a small number of teachers working with the 9<sup>th</sup> graders.  Marti said it is the same in the Math Department.</p>
<p>&#8211;David suggested that more teachers teach 9<sup>th</sup> grade so there are more teachers available for discussions and improvements.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned a former professional development on different cultures—Sharroky Hollie  and how helpful that was.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he became very expensive very fast.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony referred everyone to page 16 and cultural responsive teaching.</p>
<p>&#8211;Explore dens and define dens.  Are they useful?</p>
<p>&#8211;Look for opportunities in the Master Schedule and CPT for 9<sup>th</sup> grade teachers to collaborate.</p>
<p>&#8211;Look for opportunities in extra-curricular after school activities.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said Kristy Morrison and Doug Page said at the UBC meeting yesterday they would like to fund raise to save Futurama.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica talked about the SAP meetings.  This helps with the 9<sup>th</sup> grade transition students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray requested .7 Adv.  Algebra and  .7 Chemistry on the schedule (item deck).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Accountability (page 17)—</p>
<p>School Climate—Jessica would like to add Wellness to this area.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray talked about the Move-Up Assembly and why some of the students wanted to leave as all the scholarships went to Asian students.  Michelle said we should include events like sports teams, athletic teams, Talent Show winners, etc.  David Barrios said we should revisit how we plan this assembly, to recognize a broad range of achievement.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus mentioned increasing attendance in class.  He will take more of a hands-on approach to this next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick mentioned teachers helping with the hall sweeps next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica wanted to add the SST meetings to outcomes of Measurable Outcomes.</p>
<p>&#8211;The PTSA came up with increased communication, reflection tool for students and teachers on how students are feeling in class about the instruction and one more.  We do need to communicate more with the parents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle wanted to mention a priority of small class sizes.  If we get more students can we hire more teachers?  Marcus said yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Academic Honesty</p>
<p>&#8211;We will table this item until next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said she caught 2 students cheating yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti told of students taking photos of AP exams with their cell phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Homeroom Survey Results</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph told of his experiences in doing this survey—his first.</p>
<p>&#8211;The passing period time (5 or 7 minutes) was not clear.</p>
<p>&#8211;Most preferred the weekly homerooms.</p>
<p>&#8211;SSR overwhelmingly retained—most wanted 15 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8211;69 people voted.</p>
<p>&#8211;CPT 2times a week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph will revisit the survey to prepare the results.</p>
<p>&#8211;We need more staff to fill out the survey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Head Meeting</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></p>
<p>I.          Contingency Plans for Fall</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat talked about all the details that department heads handle.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he can’t see the district eliminating the department heads.  The principals express this to the district.</p>
<p>&#8211;As of now Department Heads have the 4<sup>th</sup> period free.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said there has to be a formal agreement for next fall to have the department heads report to school 2 days prior to the teachers arrival.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan said the district will put those duties on the responsibility of the administration.</p>
<p>&#8211;If the department head positions are not retained, the former DHs will have another class to teach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Department Head Duties 5/30 and 5/31 and 6/1.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked everyone to plan to return for these 2 days.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle would like to use the 2-3 days at their own discretion.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus would like to meet for an hour on 5/31 at 11:00am.</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked if there would be 2 full days of meetings.  We will do a 3-2—Friday and Monday meetings and Tuesday a free day.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said 2 days of meetings would be difficult as it is hard to get things done.</p>
<p>&#8211;Suggestion was made to have meetings in the am and work allowed in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:50am.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Student and Teacher Voices</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph shared conversations with students about the STAR tests.  Joseph mentioned that there are 5 different versions of the test and the questions are in different order on each of the versions.  He talked about how excited these students were about solving the math problems on the test, during their lunch hour.</p>
<p>&#8211;He talked about the RIP tombstones they made for the band program being cut.  One student asked him about the cuts.  One student said her brother was going be a Gal student next year and band is the only thing he is good at.  He told of other students who were upset about the end of the band.</p>
<p>&#8211;Then Joseph read the speech that he read to the parents and students in the auditorium at the Open House last night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Tonight, we are witnessing the last performance of the Band on this stage.</p>
<p>Every other spring concert that I have helped produce in my 18 years at Galileo has been a time of celebration. This year’s concert is different.  This is a time for mourning and sadness.  87 years ago, the Galileo Band and Galileo Piano program was born.  For 87 years, the music program has contributed to the culture and fabric of Galileo.</p>
<p>We will never hear the fight song played at Song and Yell.</p>
<p>Future graduating seniors will not be called to the stage to receive their diplomas with the clarion call of the trumpets playing the opening strains of “Pomp and Circumstance.”</p>
<p>Graduating seniors will not be able to sing the Galileo Hymn with the Band.</p>
<p>Beginning piano students will no longer be able to touch the genius of great composers like Bach, Beethoven and Mozart.</p>
<p>Incoming 9<sup>th</sup> grade students will not be able to become a part of this tradition that has been in existence since 1925!</p>
<p>Tonight, the work of a long line of dedicated, hard working music teachers comes to a crashing halt.</p>
<p>There is a chance that this may not come to pass.  Every other time that the Arts have faced a catastrophic demise, money has been found.  Budgets have been restored.  The needs and desires of students have been realized.</p>
<p>We are here to celebrate the band’s long and powerful life.  Thank you to all musicians, parents, teachers, and administrators who have helped support music at Galileo.</p>
<p>The world will little note, nor long remember what I say tonight, but it can never forget the music that has been made here. Our job is to be dedicated to the unfinished work that they who performed here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is for us to be dedicated to the great task remaining before us—to preserve the long tradition of music at Galileo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked if the SSC has discussed priorities for restoring programs.  Marcus said this would happen at their next meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick thanked Joseph for sharing his thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said that everyone needs to know about items such as this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus is in conversation with Rob Daniels about this and restoring the position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Academic Honesty</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Open House Feedback</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat said some in his department question the need for all teachers to be present.</p>
<p>&#8211;He did mention that a big wave of students and parents came by to see their display</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he agreed, but he did not know how to say who should be here and who should be excused.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise thought about teachers who travel far by public transportation or have young children.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti recalled a year in the past where only several teachers from each department were asked to be present.</p>
<p>&#8211;David suggested doing it as a department choice.  He also mentioned that this used to be more oriented to our current students, but it has become more of an 8<sup>th</sup> grade event.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph felt that the tour groups should be spaced farther apart.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph also advocated for a return to having the Fall Open House moved to week 10 so we can distribute report cards to parents—that brought many more parents to the event.  He also mentioned that some parents have students in more than 1 school and they cannot attend all the events when they are all in the same week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica shared her thoughts about the event.  She did not get as many parents as she was prepared for.  She said the feeling was chaotic and felt it did not showcase the amazing programs at Galileo.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said they tell the parents who are registering their students about the Open House.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick mentioned that if Department Chairs were the ones required to attend, they might not be available for a CPT if they are given comp time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said you cannot use where people live or how many children they have as a means of excusing teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;David felt it is better when the parents are free flowing and not in groups.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica volunteered to help see how we can change this event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Final Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;It is now posted on the Web Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         2012/2013 Bell Schedule</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David wanted to discuss the homerooms and passing times.</p>
<p>&#8211;Some teachers want homeroom every week.</p>
<p>&#8211;He also said there should be discussion on the passing periods.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy asked Patrick if there was a vote last year on the bell schedule.  Patrick said it was on the CPT—1 day or 2 for early release, which affects the bus schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked if Patrick could have the UBC put out a survey.  Patrick said the UBC would review the survey.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said her teachers felt the teachers know the students better for testing when we have a weekly homeroom.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben said for scheduling purposes it seems to be better to have consistency and have the homeroom weekly.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked Patrick to do another survey.  Patrick said the UBC will work on contractual issues.  He also said the UBC is not a paid position.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti thought the UBC was involved in creating this year’s schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben said we have a Leadership Team, a UBC and an SSC and no one wants to take the lead on this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked how many questions should be on the survey.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked for feedback.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said his department did not want to have homeroom only once a month.  Denise said her department felt the same.</p>
<p>&#8211;Bettie recalled for the group the days of Galileo being an II/USP school with low-test scores.  The Homeroom was reinstated then so that teachers could build relationships with their students which would help students want to do better on the tests.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked Stan to do a survey with 2 questions—Weekly Homeroom or not?  5 or 7 minute passing period?</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph is in favor or the weekly homeroom and a 7-minute passing period as the bathrooms are really crowded and 5 minutes is not long enough.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested we also survey the teachers about the length of SSR.  He also said that we need to be flexible.  Galileo is an organic being and we need to revisit the ground rules.</p>
<p>&#8211;David offered some insight into why we are having this discussion now.  He thought we did not make a decision on the homerooms and the passing periods.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus is happy with what makes the teachers and students happy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise suggested homeroom on one of the block days.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked if the survey should be on email or hard copy.  Joseph said he would help do a Google doc.  Joseph said it could be done during CPT next week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we would have to have plans for things to do during homeroom.</p>
<p>&#8211;Bettie talked about the many bell schedules that need to be programmed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Build On</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus introduced Chad Zibelman from Build On.</p>
<p>&#8211;Chad said they have been here since 2008, they are a national organization and their focus is to enhance education and empower youth.  This is worldwide.  This year they are an after school program; in previous years they were a lunchtime program.</p>
<p>&#8211;He mentioned that a Galileo student in this program was on the national news last week. One focus is community service.</p>
<p>&#8211;There are two full time employees in the schools to run the program.</p>
<p>&#8211;Chad would like to have a space on campus.  He would like to look at partnering with an academy or program at Galileo.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise asked if he has talked with Summerfund.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked if Build On was going to work with our groups who already do Community Service.  Chad said they would like to get other students involved as well.</p>
<p>&#8211;Chad said they are now under the umbrella of Futurama.  They are at Leadership now and they will start full time in the fall.  The organization builds schools in foreign countries and gives the students the opportunity to travel abroad and help build schools in foreign countries.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph expressed his feelings on how positive this type of work is.  He mentioned Christmas in April from the past.  He is in favor of building community service here at Galileo.</p>
<p>&#8211;Karin said she has parents who want activities for their children during the summer. She expressed her concerns to keep this open and not partner with a pathway, as that limits the student participation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII.      Master Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said they continue to work on the schedule.  This year there is more data from the district than they have ever had before.  Beginning on May 13 we will get another 100 9<sup>th</sup> graders.  We have 430 now committed to Galileo—530 were admitted.  We will get more money.  We may be facing some changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said they might have to change their department schedules, as they did not get another room.  If you have any ideas on rooms, please let David know.  He will have to change the singleton/doubleton situation.  Nancy and David will work on this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said her last day is tomorrow.  Things will continue to be influx.  Nancy is training Lauren and Nancy will keep in touch with Lauren.  Marcus and Tony have done the master schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Many items will affect the Master Schedule and there will be changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise discussed conversations with parents about 9<sup>th</sup> graders taking world languages.  Nancy said we do not have the capacity to offer world languages to 9<sup>th</sup> graders.  They do have to take the College and Career course during 9<sup>th</sup> grade.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti discussed the transition with her retiring and Doug Page taking over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph wanted to discuss the extra days for department heads.  This year we did 2 days before school and 3 days after school.  She mentioned how Vicki handled this in the past.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said since we will have Summer School at Galileo, then department heads could come in during summer school to work on the schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said they would talk about this in their administrative meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said that there was talk of Nancy moving to C &amp; I.  At this point that won’t happen and the new position is for C &amp; I.  Round 2 of interviews will be tomorrow.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise expressed her hope that we get someone who knows about high school curriculum.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle talked about the CPT and how much of it has not been productive.  She mentioned that we have not had cluster meetings.  She would like to see more of this in the CPT schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray misses the 2-hour meetings.  He said an hour is not long enough to get major tasks done.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said it is important for teachers to share their best practice with their colleagues.  He thought these meetings should be interdepartmental.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti felt that we need to know ahead of time when meetings are scheduled—weeks ahead of time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti suggested doing a survey or room need, ratios.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned rumors in the district about eliminating department head positions and AP preps.  Then we will need more rooms.</p>
<p>&#8211;David felt we should minimize teachers having to move during the school day.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti will look at the ratios. Michelle and David will help her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked everyone to thank Richard McDowell for his hard work on winning a 2-year grant worth $50,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Head Agenda</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.  Balanced Score Card Review</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed some current information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Item tabled until next meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Professional Development Day Feedback</p>
<p>&#8211;His department appreciated the flexibility of the day and that teachers could catch up as being very valuable.</p>
<p>&#8211;Others agreed.  Many said it was the best PD day they’ve ever had.  They had time to get things accomplished.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said the best PD days are those that are on-site.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti said her department really enjoyed the flexibility.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus thanked everyone for the feedback.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray learned that IEP meetings are not optional and IEP teachers and administrators must attend the meeting from beginning to end unless a box is check on the form that they will only attend part of the time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said it is difficult when teachers have to attend an IEP on their prep time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the district is going to work on making IEPs more streamlined.</p>
<p>&#8211;It is an administrator’s duty to find coverage for teachers who have to attend an IEP during their class time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said that IEPs should never take more than an hour.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said all of his teachers will check the box saying “Part of” for teachers and administrators attending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the agenda for the department heads 2 days prior to start of school.  The department heads need time outside of meetings to get work done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked for input for the survey for homerooms and passing times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 12:25pm.</p>
