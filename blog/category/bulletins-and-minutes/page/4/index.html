<p align="center"><b> </b></p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 11:20am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Emergency Drills</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said that we need to get back to practicing the drills.  She said we will have one this month.  She asked the group for feedback on the last drills last semester.</p>
<p>&#8211;The group preferred the last week of February.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the Healthy Kids Survey and when it will be given—either a Tuesday or Friday of the last week of February.</p>
<p>&#8211;Alan said there is a tech event that Friday (27<sup>th</sup>).</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy suggested Monday, February 23, 2015.  This will be a fire drill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Drink Tap Assembly</p>
<p>&#8211;Friday, March 6, 2015.  It will be an invitational assembly using the filling stations.  Encourage your teachers to attend.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we have one in the cafeteria and we may get one more.  Every student who comes will be given the Hetch-Hetchy water bottle.  Friday, March 6<sup>th</sup> 11:45 am – 112:20pm is the time scheduled.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed about how many bottles we have left and how to distribute them.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus suggested giving students who attend the assembly a ticket and then they can turn in the ticket for a bottle.</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked how often the filter will be replaced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       AP Test Administration &amp; Sign-Up</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug mentioned a plan Stephen Emmi was working on and that would be to have all students taking the tests to sign up at the same time and pay at that time.</p>
<p>&#8211;He mentioned Washington uses an AP Coordinator (.2) and he was paid for collecting the funds.  Lowell funds a person to do all AP activities.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug says teachers are walking around with lots of money and what happens if someone steals the money?</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the money should be turned in to the AP Coordinator.</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked what happens if students don’t qualify for a reduced rate, what happens if they don’t sign up for the test? Nancy said she used to handle those cases.  A statement from the parents should qualify a student for the reduced rate.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug told the group how he handles it.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said everyone enrolled in the AP courses should take the tests.</p>
<p>&#8211;Information is due March 2<sup>nd</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stephen Emmi clarified the $5 fee and the form they must fill out.  He mentioned we are no longer getting information on free and reduced price lunch.</p>
<p>Classes will visit the counseling office as a group on a pre-arranged date to sign-up and pay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Criteria for Selecting Teachers to Assess IWA (Integrated Writing Assessment)</p>
<p>&#8211;This is given to 9<sup>th</sup> graders.  The purpose is to calibrate writing.  Last year all 9<sup>th</sup> grade English teachers but one went.  This year AP teachers with writing will be the ones to participate in this.  We will go through each department.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said this test is the one that looks the most like the Smarter Balance which students take in the 11<sup>th</sup> grade.  Topics in the test are science, social science, and not necessarily novels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Feedback from CLRP Presentation</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked for feedback from the group.</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat asked about a subject like math.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug has not found helpful information from this activity.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said one strategy for Math is “Get out of your seat.”  He demonstrated this activity.  We need to address many types of learners.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the next area would be participation points to engage all students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Stephen Jackson mentioned an email he sent to the group about “At a Glance Documents.”  He mentioned they are all on Google Drive.  You can view a list of students who have IEPs and can see basic information about the students.  He mentioned the documents will be updated after an IEP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren distributed a calendar with Senior Activities in May.  She discussed the events on the calendar.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren will ask for volunteers to read names at graduation.</p>
<p>&#8211;Forms for department honors will be distributed later this week.  Deadline will most likely be mid-March.</p>
<p>&#8211;Students nominated for honors will be checked by the Deans’ Office for cheating referrals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 12:05pm.</p>

<p align="center"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team/Department Heads Meeting</span></b></p>
<p align="right"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></b></p>
<p align="center"><b>1/27/15</b></p>
<p align="center"><b> </b></p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 11:20am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team Agenda</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Bell Schedule 2/16 – 2/18/15</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked about the bell schedule for the week of 2/16.  Wednesday will be a regular bell schedule.  We need to check with Transportation see if this will work.</p>
<p>End time will be 3:10pm .  We need to see if we can get the busses to come at 3:10 rather than 2:10pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Mid-Year School Capacity Activity</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus explained the self-assessment activity.  He distributed it and we will combine what everyone contributes.</p>
<p>This is a rubric and he explained the different sections.  He asked everyone to quickly read the first section.  We skipped to 1.2, 2<sup>nd</sup> box.  Marcus asked everyone to read this section.</p>
<p>&#8211;Good teaching practice means random checking to see that everyone is participating.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed on the SST, SAP, SART, and participation of teachers with perhaps a floating substitute.</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan gave her thoughts on the SST, SAP, SART and IEPs.  These are all difficult to schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug felt it is important to have the whole team present at these meetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;School Team meetings is the second topic to discuss.  Doug gave his impression on where the school teams are.  Time and training need more development.  Joseph discussed the difference between “always” and “consistently.”  We fall under “consistently.”</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we would do several of these discussions at upcoming meetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Exit Exam</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy will borrow some teachers this Thursday to train them for the Exit Exam.  She will send an email.</p>

<p>I.  School Capacities</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa began by telling the group every year we put in a request to EPC on how many students we want to have for the next year.  We take into account returning students, traveling teachers, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;We currently have 1908 students and we are funded at about 1976 students.  We will get 40 newcomers.</p>
<p>&#8211;We will not be making decisions today, just getting input.  Do we want to be smaller or larger—this will all affect funding and staffing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David Barrios asked about the budget.  Does our budget go up as the district has more money for next year?  He asked if we get more money can we lower the number of students and still get the funding.  Science feels that the most professional thing to strive for is one teacher per classroom.  He would opt for smaller class sizes, so lower enrollment if we are getting more money per student.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan said you lower the number of students, you have fewer faculty and fewer staff.  She said there are changes in different school sites.  She mentioned the new middle school that is being set up differently.  The district is also very fond of administrative costs, so all the funding is not equally distributed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Stephen Jackson asked how many teachers we would lose with lower enrollment.  Lisa said 150 students for one teacher per department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said there are way too many variables in this equation.  We need to look at specifics, like how many teachers does this involve.  If we are going to lose teachers, then we could probably have more students.  Lisa said it does involve a lot of factors.  Do we want to stay where we are now, grow a little or go down?</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug asked if we stay the same would our class sizes go up.  Stephen Emmi said class sizes will grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said they would like to see VAPA grown by 100 students and bring back band.  He felt there always will be traveling teachers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle Moffett did not have a chance to have a conversation with her department to answer the questions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle also mentioned bringing in new academies and pathways.  She felt that we need to look at how course offerings will look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat for Social Sciences said they feel they are at full strength, like their class sizes and do not want to lose anybody.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said if we keep 1908 we will have less funding next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan said parents are looking for schools that have lots of choices for their children.  The choice comes down to a difficult decision.  If we do no have electives that make high school more enjoyable, we will lose students to other schools.  Traveling will always happen based on our number of classrooms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Bai said many parents ask him about class sizes.  More students in the building and higher class sizes are not desirable to prospective parents.  He said some parents would like more VAPA classes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said if we have more students, we get more money.  We also run out of classrooms if we have more students.  We have to look the CORE classes that students need.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said we do not know right now how much more money we will have, as the district is changing how they do the WSF.  The district has said the WSF will be conservative next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David said more students do not necessarily mean more electives.  He mentioned several electives in Science, but it is important to recruit students for the electives.  He felt that no staff should be cut.  He would like to see the numbers remain the same or go down by just a few students if the attrition from our staff can accommodate that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug recalled 3 or 4 years ago that we had 2100 students and everyone seemed to fit.  He mentioned the addition of room 354 as a classroom.  Lisa said some periods have no available classrooms.  He felt giving teachers their own room is a preference question, not a capacity question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle Moffett mentioned co-teachers and planning time and the benefits of having their own room for preps.  We may have to revisit CPT and using more for planning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Stephen Jackson asked about the space behind room 105 in the “garage” area where autoshop classes met.  He said we should be more aggressive in finding and refitting spaces.  Susan talked about events at GWHS and funding converting rooms that were the shop areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Stephen Emmi and Lisa discussed some building requests from the past that have not happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa asked about our preferences for the total number of newcomer students.  We are funded and budgeted at 150.  We have 128 right now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked if we can influence the newcomer students number for next year.  Lisa said we are a newcomer pathway school.  She put out numbers on class sizes.</p>
<p>Michelle said Kathleen wants the class sizes small and the students need them small as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said the information will go to the High School Office today and it will go to the district tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 10:30am.</p>

<p align="center"><b> </b></p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 11:20am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team Agenda</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Communication</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle had 2 questions from her department.  Why not communicate with the 15% of teachers who are not posting on School Loop?  Marcus said the current parents have lots of experience with School Loop and want the teachers to post regularly and often.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said there should be a window for responding.  He also suggested that the parents still have the middle school mind set and we need to convert them to high school communication.  We should let the parents know what will be different in high school.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus suggested all students are different and respond at different rates.  He gave an example of his children.</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan asked how many parents are on School Loop.  Stan DeBella said 30%.  Susan wanted to know how many parents actually check daily.  Marcus said he checks on his daughter every day.  She asked about all the parents who are not on School Loop.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said as a school we need to make sure parents register for School Loop.  Parent involvement is a big thing.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the teachers who are not posting—are they being encouraged to post?  Do we let them know we want them to use School Loop to communicate with parents?  Marcus has spoken to some of them.  Student should know their grades at all times.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said 80% of her department uses School Loop.  Why do we have to post more often because some teachers are not doing it?</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we have some high-powered parents with high-powered connections.</p>
<p>&#8211;Do we have alternative ways of communicating, like Progress Reports?</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan feels there should be something in the welcome to Galileo packet about the importance of students advancing in independence, studying, etc.  Marcus asked for the process at her son’s high school and then asked her to write that process up.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned there are things we can do with our students here and then there are district activities.  He said the grievance about forcing teaches to use School Loop is still on the table.  If the administration feels it is important for teachers to post, then they should provide CPT time to post.  Marcus said he could hold faculty meetings after school.  Joseph said only two per month.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he is frustrated that the administration does not have extra time to communicate with the teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan clarified that the expectation for posting has not changed—it is every 3 weeks this year. Next year Marcus would like it to be every 2 weeks. He feels that posting every 2 weeks helps teachers keep up with their grades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle put out a general request for more timely communication in response to teachers’ emails with regard to admin.  Marcus said he is more of a face-to-face person and he gets many emails.  Michelle mentioned that they are being asked to use this technology tool as finding people takes more time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         CAHSEE</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy will send out information to all of the teachers this week about logistics, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan said his teachers requested classrooms for the testing and where we can relocate the athletic activities during the testing. There is a basketball game after the second day of testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       CLRP Faculty Meeting Preview &amp; Assignments</p>
<p>&#8211;Validation of culture as a person, gender wise, nationality.  This is about validating people as individuals.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus presented an exercise that he used to do.  This has to do with journal writing.  He gave the rules.  Name and date at the top of the paper.  Do not worry about punctuation.  Write to the edge of the paper.  It does not matter what you write about.</p>
<p>-–Participation points were very important in this activity he used in the classroom. Sharing what you write is voluntary. He plans to do this exercise at the next faculty meeting and he will not use the same song.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus gave the group 5 minutes to finish their writing to the first hole punch in the paper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked if anyone wanted to share what they wrote.  Joseph went first.  Alicia read.  Stephen Jackson read.  David Barrios read. David Beauvais read. Susan wrote about music and talked about Bob Dylan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked what just happed?  He said we got a chance to talk and relate and this is a good way to create relationships with students.  He gave a few examples.  Relationships are important.  Discussion followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the topic of the next book club is “The Model Minority.”</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus gave an assignment to talk about what you can do to validate culture in our department and content area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus would like to have another meeting about School Capacities this week. The meeting will be held this Thursday at the beginning of 4<sup>th</sup> period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.               CAHSEE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nancy reports we are working as much as we can to do promotion&#8230;letter to parents, working on getting information on the web, posted posters around campus, and class meetings with information</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy out a request to prepare students for the exam in departments/classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked about athletic matches and practices.  Wrestling will get moved to an away match on Tuesday, Basketball on Wednesday will be ok.  There are concerns about practices Monday &#8211; Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8211;Students will be tested will be 10th grade and 12th grade; Nancy will double check on this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy stressed that tables have to specifically be set apart by a certain amount of space.</p>
<p>&#8211;Labeling students by grade level they have credits for&#8230;use counselor or classes to tell what actual year they are in HS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.             Detention</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy reported that Lunch Time Detention started yesterday, overall successful.</p>
<p>A few students didn’t show up, there were calls home, and if they don’t show up today they will be suspended.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nurse Kitchell requested hall sweeps on 1st floor Polk Street side regularly.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked about the issue regarding students who don’t show getting suspended.  He made the point that punishment shouldn’t be them not attending school (getting suspended).  Is that an appropriate punishment?</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said the suspensions are a way to show students that we are serious about lunch detentions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked what the offense would be because we cannot use “K” for willful defiance anymore.</p>
<p>&#8211;David Beauvais spoke about the two types of students this might apply to and how it might work.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nurse Kitchell agreed with Ethan that perhaps the punishment doesn’t fit the crime&#8230;perhaps an in-school suspension.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus mentioned that in-school suspension requires a certificated staff member.</p>
<p>&#8211;David Beauvais is working to enlist parent support; parent meetings will happen before suspension, and then a meeting with the Principal might be the next step.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stephen Jackson was also thinking about in-school suspension but understands the cost issue, and he asked what chronic truant rate at school is.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion that it’s about 10 students wandering the halls.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stephen Jackson mentioned using the small size of the group to tailor interventions to each student.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug asked what were the numbers yesterday?</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy: provided the following: 10 on list, 5 attended, 3 not in 4th period, 2 ignored requests to attend.  Can serve 10-15 students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nurse Kitchell expressed concern about all the names on the walkie-talkies and privacy concerns.  Also, she asked what time are you doing first period because Muni is sometimes the reason.  Lastly, what about feeding them?</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said: 1st period sweep is at 8:30am.  Cafeteria is brining lunch for all students regardless of free/reduced lunch status.</p>
<p>—David Barrios was attempting to address problem of students arriving to class late.   Lauren agreed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Alicia thanked Dean’s Office for this.  She knows it takes effort.  Even students knowing about it could make a difference regarding number of tardies.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said in his 21st year at Galileo, we have tried lots of different things; he thinks this solution might really work.  Not for the chronic attendance issues but for the slow to class students who still attend and don’t see the urgency in getting to class on time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said that due to all the advertisements, students clearly knew about program.  Hallways were very quiet yesterday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned.</p>
