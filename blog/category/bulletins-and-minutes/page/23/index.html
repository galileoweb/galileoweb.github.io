<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team/Department Heads Meeting</span></strong></p>
<p align="right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>2/23/12</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Academic Honesty</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus emailed his colleagues and received information from Lincoln and Balboa that he shared with the group.  He asked members to take the information back to their departments for feedback.  He suggested we table this item until the next meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Master Schedule Update</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said we are done registering students on the Google form. She is waiting for the district to be ready for the district registration.  She hopes to be able to have counselors start this process in the next several days.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy will need to get information from this group about placements and she will send out a Google dock for this issue.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle brought up the fact that some teachers feel with some students it is not a good idea for them to register for honors or AP classes.  She asked about the process.  Nancy reviewed the problems we had with this last fall.</p>
<p>&#8211;If a teacher does not give approval for an AP or honors class, the counseling office will honor the teacher’s request.  There is a criteria for honors and AP classes and if the students do not meet the criteria, then they should not take those classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said his department has so many students signing up, that they have to cut students, so they drop the students who do not qualify.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti discussed how the Math department did this last year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus mentioned the superintendent’s policy, but if we have criteria, we can honor that.  We also look at each student on an individual basis.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy will send out information next week.  She would like to have information by March 16<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked which weeks of the first 6-weeks a student could opt out of honors or AP classes.  Nancy said that they need to go through the 7-step process.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said there would not be placement tests for incoming 9<sup>th</sup> graders in May, as the district changes the information over the summer.  This year we will do the placement tests the first few days of school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked about the Feb. 6<sup>th</sup> access to Scheduler.  This always causes a “crunch.”  Nancy said she has to enter the information on Scheduler and it is easier to provide this information to the faculty after it has been entered.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben asked when the new system, Genesis, will be ready.  Nancy said we are supposed to be using it by this time next year.  Nancy said the district has not signed the contract yet.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said the name has been changed to Synergy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the budget is due on March 23<sup>rd</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said that low-level ELL students should not be taking foreign language.  Nancy said that it can be posted on the transcripts that these students have taken foreign language.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise asked when we will know how many students and how many sections?  She mentioned that we will need to order books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Budget Update</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said we would take a $659,000 hit next year.  This is reflecting a drop of 147 students.  We are being budgeted at what we are showing now.  2,074 students for next year.  Ethan asked if there is Scenarios A, B and C, and Katie said no.  She also mentioned that schools across the district are looking at the same drops.  We are getting more SCE and AP monies, down in all other categories.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we would be moving fast with the SSC to make decisions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie asked everyone to hoard supplies, as it will be thinner next year.  She asked everyone to conserve supplies so we can go with a lower operating budget.  The district is mandating that 2% of budgets have to go for operating budget. David would like to know how that compares with our budget this year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked if it would be SSC, Administration, and Leadership Team making the decisions on cuts.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said the district will issue many lay-off notices—it will be blanketed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we will work from our priorities, and then A-G requirements.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we would know by March 23<sup>rd</sup> if we will have layoffs.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said the two priorities are to keep staff and keep lower class sizes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said there are still some protected positions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said last year we spent $292,000—on operating budget—that is 3% of our total budget.  Next year we will have $177,513 for operating budget.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise asked about ordering books for next year and what the deadlines will be.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked if the seniors have to pay for their own graduation.  The seniors now have $17.000 and graduation costs around $13,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Hall Sweep Update</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison reported on the Hall Sweeps.  We have done 3 of them and we will continue to do this once a day for the next week and then on a random basis.  Everyone who is caught gets detention that day.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said this is fantastic.  He mentioned that the security aides have had hours and pay cuts. Please thank the security aides for their hard work with the hall sweeps.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise mentioned the U’s for citizenship grades for tardies, absences, electronics, etc.  She would like to see this enforced as a school policy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph would like to have the administration see the attendance issues the parents complain about from the teachers’ perspectives.</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison said hall passes now have become a hot commodity as students are grabbing them so they can be in the halls.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said we should gather some data—why are students out of class, how many hall passes have been stolen, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise suggested we always ask students why they are out of class in the halls.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen suggested a secret code on the back of the pass.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we will discuss this again in a few weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         NASA Visit Update</p>
<p>&#8211;We now have the name of the astronaut—Captain Daniel W. Bursch.</p>
<p>&#8211;Karen sent out 11 invitations to district personnel.  She has heard from 6 that they will be coming.</p>
<p>&#8211;Karin has 36 confirmed students and would like to have 9 more.  The students will mingle with the district personnel, the NASA visitors, can win prizes, and other benefits.</p>
<p>&#8211;Karin distributed information on the event.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said it would be great to include some of the under served students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the date for the Spring Open House.  Marcus said we would table this item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Professional Courtesy</p>
<p>&#8211;Mathew mentioned an email folks received from one of his department members.  This involved a staff member removing a student from the classroom without acknowledging the teacher, while the class was taking a test.</p>
<p>&#8211;We should greet each other as professionals.  This is great for morale.  Remind out department members to say Hi to other adults.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said it was easier to meet other teachers when faculty meetings were held in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben reminded everyone not to give students your passwords.  Do not let students enter grades, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus thanked Jessica, Wellness, and GSA for the LoveFest.  We also got good press from Ms. Franzen’s class at Crissy Field.  Also, thanks to Sgt. Hardee and Rebecca for the BSU assembly.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle felt that this assembly was invitational, but if it concerns cultural awareness, everyone should go.  It is hard to have mandatory assemblies, but we need to make sure students can go to assemblies concerning their cultures.</p>
<p>&#8211;Some suggested that some boring assemblies be eliminated.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned the two invitational assemblies he puts on.  He discussed the timing and felt that the last week of a grading period is not a good time for an assembly.</p>
<p>&#8211;On March 5<sup>th</sup>, SFPD will put on a presentation on different careers.  They will target students who are on the cusp of truancy.  Students will be given a pass to the presentation.  These are not chronically truant students.   This will address what students can do with just a high school diploma.</p>
<p>&#8211;Requests were made to have this presentation at other than class time.  Allison said she is not able to do the scheduling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leadership Team adjourned at 11:15pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Heads</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Policy for Students Returning Books</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said Allison Wagner is seeing a problem with Cyber High and the materials that are distributed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Some felt we have no policy for returning textbooks.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph felt the real deadline is when they graduate.  He felt that they should be penalized at the end of each school year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick suggested we table this until we get a clear handle on the program.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said her department hands out the cards, if the books are not returned then Connie goes after the students to return the books.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned the English department book room usually gets all returned books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         CPT-ELL</p>
<p>&#8211;This will be the topic for Wednesday’s meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus will distribute information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       School Loop/Department Meeting</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned an email Marcus distributed from a parent.  Much discussion in her department and between department heads followed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked what Marcus’ response to the parent was.  Marcus said he emailed the individual teachers of the students to email the parent.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle would like to see what the teachers thought about this and what kind of support they can expect.</p>
<p>&#8211;This will be tabled until the next meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;David felt this should be brought up at the next faculty meeting, and Marcus could provide his expectations.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti and Michelle thought mixing with other department members would produce helpful conversations about School Loop—strategies, practices, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise mentioned the startling of the short bell rings for the custodians.  Is there another way of alerting the custodians?</p>
<p>&#8211;David saw that the next staff meeting is March 14<sup>th</sup>, and he thought we might move it up to February 29<sup>th</sup>, as the following week is not an early release date.</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat asked for a quick decision on this as he has a guest speaker scheduled.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said he has databases to promote in each department.  Some teachers use these for research projects.  David said these have citable sources.  Patrick will come to department meetings and provide instructions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said there was no tardy report with the bell schedule options—passing time 5 minutes or 7 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked Marcus about Special Ed data.  She mentioned she has heard that some of the regular ed. teachers are not the best match for students coming out of special ed. Teachers are labeled “effective” or “not effective” with working with these students.  She felt some of the language should be changed when asking teachers if they will accept these students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested that no class should have more than the percentage of Special Ed students in the school.  He said this is an equity issue.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said it is an equity issue for students as well.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise suggested para support in the classroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:30am.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team/Department Heads Meeting</span></strong></p>
<p align="right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>2/9/12</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.            Academic Honesty</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus received a report from Mr. Flisak on cheating.  Marcus asked the group for their input.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben said copying and cheating is the norm.  David Barrios said he gives a “0” on an assignment if he catches a student cheating.</p>
<p>&#8211;Delores  Lee said that kids take pictures of homework and post it on Facebook.  Test are also posted on Facebook.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben found students copying right in front of him with homework for another teacher.  He sends students to the Deans’ Office for suspension when he catches cheating.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy mentioned students attempting to cheat on the CAHSEE yesterday.  Even though the questions are in different order for different versions of the test, Tony said it is possible to match the graphics and copy answers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica wanted to know what message students get from Galileo about cheating—messages on walls about zero tolerance?</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen felt that we need to define cheating.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said her teachers cover in the beginning of the year what is and what is not cheating.  Different teachers have different policies, but they state them and the consequences in their syllabus.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph felt it is hard to start a new policy now, but the group disagreed.</p>
<p>&#8211;David talked about an incident last year where the student who was receiving the department award was caught cheating.  It was a difficult situation.  He felt that no student thinks cheating is OK, but that it is easy to get away with.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen told of a similar incident.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said cheating is not acceptable at any time of the year.  He spreads the students out and does as much as he can to make sure they do not cheat.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle felt teachers are changing the way they are assessing students, especially at the college level.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony mentioned, “When does collaborating become cheating?”</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben felt we have to deal with the issue of students wanting to get points for good grades.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus will call other principals to see what is happening at other schools and we will continue the discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph talked about artists and musicians modeling their work after their predecessors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.            Bell Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we are still working on the spreadsheet for the student survey.  We are looking at A and B and the difference is the amount of passing period minutes.  Tony is still working on the student schedules.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked if there are more students late with a 5-minute passing period, versus a 7-minute passing period. Concrete data will be good.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony talked about information on School Loop about tardies—biggest amount was for first period and then right after lunch.</p>
<p>&#8211;Suggestion was made to compare 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> period tardies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.            School Loop</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed a packet on School Loop.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he gets lots of interest from the parents about School Loop, particularly the 9th and 10<sup>th</sup> grade parents, as they are used to it from middle school.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus told of his experience at the training for School Loop.  The trainer has a student at Galileo and she was disappointed she only hears from one of her son’s teacher on School Loop.</p>
<p>&#8211;66% of our teachers completed the survey on School Loop.  Most of those felt comfortable using School Loop.  Tony went through questions on the survey and some of the results.</p>
<p>&#8211;Needing training and lack of time were the main reasons teachers were not using School Loop.  The training is from 4-6pm, after the working day.</p>
<p>&#8211;25% of parents are registered to use School Loop.  Ray mentioned that we have a minority using School Loop.  Tony said at his former school 90% of the parents were using it and all the teachers were.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben felt that we need to tell parents what is going on with their kids.  Patrick felt we have high school students.  The parent is not holding their hand all the time, but we do need to check on how the students are doing.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed about using School Loop, time it takes to post grades, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph told of his experiences and he said it is a good communication tool with the students who use it more often than the parents. Joseph felt the trainings should be done in the common planning time, not after school.  4-6pm is his time and there are other activities that he needs to do.  We are professionals and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>&#8211;The district is using our building for a district-wide School Loop training, and that is why it is scheduled from 4-6pm.</p>
<p>&#8211;David suggested we do in-house training.  Many teachers do not know how to do many of the items on School Loop.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan says School Loop takes time.  He would like the district to do a survey of what times during the day/evening/night the data is input.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we will use School Loop next year in some way.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said that School Loop is a contract issue.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said if we have School Loop access at school, the principal can put it in the Principal’s Expectations.</p>
<p>&#8211;David Barrios brought up the fact that those teachers not contacting parents by School Loop are contacting parents in other ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.            February 14<sup>th</sup> Wellness &amp; GSA Event</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica talked about this event.  This concerns sexual health and teen relationships.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica said she had 2 pregnant students in her office this morning.  This happens often.</p>
<p>&#8211;She talked about students in abusive relationships.</p>
<p>&#8211;She talked about students working on “coming out” to their parents.</p>
<p>&#8211;This event will be highlighted on the district website next week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Our ELL students do not know where to get reproductive information.</p>
<p>&#8211;There will be 42 workshops this year. She asked the members of this group to sign up.</p>
<p>&#8211;Some teachers are giving students extra credit for the noon-time activities.  Please encourage your teachers to participate.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said some of his students asked him to officiate at their wedding at the event.  Jessica told him to see Jackie Peters.  She told of the educational games by the marriage booths.</p>
<p>&#8211;Price to get married is 50 cents.  Proceeds go to GSA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.            Policy for Food Sales</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat asked what the school policy is. Marcus said there should not be any food sales on campus.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica said any candy sales for students are against district policy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Food Sales to teachers are OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.            Rise in Hall Walking</p>
<p>&#8211;We are being vigilant to curb this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII.            CAHSEE</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said the auditorium was chaos and not well thought out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Head</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus gave kudos to Ray for his efforts to give Special Ed. students the regular tests.</p>
<p>&#8211;CST—California Standards Test—what everyone takes.  CMA is a modified assessment.  It is almost as difficult as the CST.  CMA does not count towards the school’s API.</p>
<p>&#8211;CAPA is for the severely impaired students.</p>
<p>&#8211;State goal is to have no more than 3% of students taking the CMA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.            Testing Update</p>
<p>&#8211;City College Placement Exam is February 24<sup>th</sup> for seniors going to City College.  It will be at Galileo from approximately 8am-noon.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said last year CCSF gave the SFUSD priority for 2 classes they had to take.  This year our students attending CCSF have to have at least 3 classes that will transfer to a 4 year university.</p>
<p>&#8211;The test will be given in the library.  Students sign up for the test.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray would like his students to take the test at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8211;CAHSEE—this past one was our census test and counts for the API score.  On both dates we tested 98% of the students we were supposed to test.  We needed to test at least 95%.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said it was a little bit chaotic for those students who did not have a place to go when their classrooms were being used.  This is a whole school effort.  She asked for cooperation from all staff and teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise mentioned miscommunication on the second day.  The time of 10:30am was confusing and some students did not finish by that time.  Denise asked about students who did not report to her class until after 11am.  Discussion followed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested we plan a fun activity for those students who finish the test by 10:30am.  Kathleen said that some kids might rush through the test to go out and play.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the auditorium and how it was used.  Joseph turned the house lights up, as he felt it was too dark inside.</p>
<p>&#8211;Those two specific days are the only days we can do the CAHSEE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;9<sup>th</sup> Grade Practice CAHSEE</p>
<p>&#8211;This year we can decide if we want to give it.  Ray and Kathleen both said, “No.”</p>
<p>&#8211;Will having the test improve our passing rate?  Ray said there are no stakes.  Decision made not to give it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.            Registration</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said they should finish on time by Feb. 17<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;We can enter the information in Scheduler right after that, by the beginning of March.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.            Academic Literacy Discussion Check-in</p>
<p>&#8211;Academic Literacy is a school priority.  First we have to define academic literacy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat said his department included reading, writing, academic norms—bring materials to class, ask for help, etc.  Know how to act in academic environment.</p>
<p>&#8211;Science focused on the standards. Specifics come from the standards.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said her department came up with definitions—and ability to navigate all of their classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said her department mostly talked about AP classes and what is expected of these students.  High literacy is one of the issues.  They do SSR in the target language.</p>
<p>Students who are ELD in their classes do very well.  They learn from the ground up.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned his department came up with 40 words that would apply to all his classes and were what the students should know by graduation.  He also liked the academic norms—bring a pencil.</p>
<p>&#8211;Standard Literacy in an Academic School, then Department literacy—Tony mentioned this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Academic Literacy means different things to different people.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said in their department said they talked about navigating through a textbook, etc. He mentioned the parts of a textbook.  These things need to be taught.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony will put all this information together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.            Common Formative Assessments &amp; Data Director</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus gave some background information on the usefulness of this information.</p>
<p>&#8211;The goal is for every course to have a common assessment and have a common final exam.</p>
<p>&#8211;This goal is for next fall.</p>
<p>&#8211;One a piece of data is entered for a student, it is linked to the content standards and teachers can watch their students over time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Any assessment teachers are now doing can be digitized.  This requires using rubrics.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said the big task is to get together with the teachers to work this out.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony said it will take time to get this all set up.  What am I teaching, how am I teaching, and do I have a good collaborative relationship with other teachers who are teaching the same course?</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed.</p>
<p>&#8211;David mentioned that much has been going on this year with data, etc., and there has not been much time to talk about curriculum.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise is not sure how to explain this to her colleagues.  She asked for Tony to come and help her.  She also mentioned Chinese literacy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle talked about Common Planning Time.  In the past one hour was Cluster Meetings, and one hour was Department Time.  She said this year they do not have the time to do this.  Marcus said those discussions will happen once we get the CLA and Data Director in place.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus told about his experience at Thurgood Marshall.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony said he is hearing that teachers want to have more planning time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said we need more staff development.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said everyone in the district supports CLA, but Data Director is not mandatory now.  We need to develop the CLAs first and then get to Data Director.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11;50AM.</p>

<p align="right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>1/26/12</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.            Priorities Update</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed the Possible Priorities based on our last meeting.  He encouraged input from the group.</p>
<p>&#8211;The last 4 were identified in the WASC review, as was the 9th Grade Transition.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus indicated here were extra SSC meetings.  He talked about the discussion in the SSC meeting.  He said that each and every department needs to identify the needs in Academic Literacy.  What data do you want to attach to each item?  The next SSC meeting will be in 2 weeks.  Please discuss priorities in your department on Feb. 8<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.            Registration Update</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy thanked everyone for turning in their course descriptions in a timely manner.  The counselors have started registering students.</p>
<p>&#8211;In the Spring of 2013 we will be using Genesis, which is a new program for online registration.</p>
<p>&#8211;Teachers sign up with the individual counselors.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said registration would finish in 4 weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.            Computer Lab</p>
<p>&#8211;This was a topic at the last UBC meeting.  One thing was Papa has to open the door for all the students.  Don thought the Computer Lab should use the AA2 key.  Everyone agreed.  We will revisit this later in the year.  There is a problem with students being in the lab unsupervised.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked if a teacher would leave the door unlocked.  We can set it up so that they door will also be locked.  Do not let other students in.  Unsupervised students must have a pass from their teacher.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen would like to visit the gaming policy.  She felt many students should be studying instead of gaming.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben wondered if some computers are designated “academic use only.”  We do not have a person to supervise this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said the library has been full at lunch time but there are free computers.  We need to let students know they should go to the library.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked Patrick to help him with a policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.            Bell Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said the overwhelming response were A &amp; B.  A is what we have now and B is what we have now with a 7 minute passing.  Many in the room said it is not what they wanted.  Spec. Ed. wants the homeroom back.</p>
<p>&#8211;Science &amp; VPA did not like the short Tuesday.  They like the shorter block as well,</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said maybe what we have is now is the basis for next year’s schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Many felt the 5-minute passing period was hard for teachers who travel.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said the 2 common planning times were the most important part of the schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said that the students had a survey yesterday and he will have the results soon.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph would like to see data concerning how many students were late with 5 minutes vs. 7 minutes.  Some felt that students would be late no matter how long the passing period is.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy mentioned that the district letters reflect tardies—3 tardies equal an absence.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti said the 5-minute passing period is a rush for everyone.  Tone of the classroom is difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.            CPT Feedback regarding 1/25/12</p>
<p>&#8211;The Social Studies Department wants to thank the administration for the unstructured planning time.  Marcus asked what we should call this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked that this type of information on unstructured planning time be given to the teachers several weeks in advance.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked for a quick vote—David said teacher discretion; Patrick said the chairs of each department could call a meeting; David said discretionary time would still let the chairs call a meeting; Ben felt that the department heads want to know ahead of time when is discretionary time.  Denise suggested calling it department head lead-time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.            Sufficient Lead Time</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph discussed getting confusing messages and not having enough time to change plans.  He mentioned the short notice for the assembly that is scheduled for this Friday.</p>
<p>&#8211;It was mentioned that it was on the calendar.  Michelle mentioned that many are not always checking the calendar, particularly as items are added to the calendar all the time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned that when we went to digital, the communication is not as good.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben gave his perspective on the advantages of collaborative leadership.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said technology is wonderful, but many teachers cannot sit in front of the computer all the time.  She said that we need to carve out a time to check for updates to the calendar.  It is helpful to get information a week or so in advance.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said if something comes up we should be notified in more than one way—calendar, email, bulletin, on G-House TV.  We should use all of our avenues.</p>
<p>&#8211;We are moving from a paper to a technology age.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested checking calendar every day should be a Principal’s Expectation.  Joseph said we need time to do this.  Marcus said the time is a challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said he is the Environmental Liaison working with Lisa Franzen and he asked for ideas from the group for greening up the school.  Ray liked the program yesterday; Karin said the cafeteria could use some help.  Stan said it would be on a schedule starting with lights, electricity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Head Agenda</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.            Department Head Selections</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked everyone to write their new department chair selection on a piece of paper and give it to him.</p>
<p>&#8211;The Department Head commitment is for 3 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.            CLA &amp; Common Assessment</p>
<p>&#8211;This is a district priority.  This opens on February 21<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus has adjusted his goal to the Fall Semester 2012. Every department should have a CLA for every course.  It must be put into Data Director.  See Marcus or Tony if you are having problems.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray explained how it will work in his department.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise shared what is happening in her department.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said his project-based learning is hard to input into Data Director.  He said many of his students start at 0.  Marcus said he should compare the data from the end of one year to the next.  Denise discussed the same thing in her department.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick suggested 2 articles for members to read—one in the <span style="text-decoration: underline">NY Times</span> and the other in the <span style="text-decoration: underline">SF Chronicle</span>. Patrick felt the CLA is district driven and there are not enough resources and time to do this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph discussed testing vs. assessment.  An assessment is produced internally in the classroom.  Marcus gave an example with world languages.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti discussed how her department worked with the CLA.  She said her department would like to add to the CLA with their own assessments.  Marcus said they will be able to add this to Data Director.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.            Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph wanted to talk about Powerful Teaching.  He talked about an article in the NY Times about a soccer coach in England.  This interview contained the information that this coach contributed his success to good teachers.  Joseph gave an example from his own schooling and mentioned a specific quote.  He also mentioned a former teacher here—Mel Esqueta and talked about his plays.  Our kids need inspiration and they need to see passion from the teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph brought in a book about numbers, music, cosmology, and geometry.  He shared some items from the book.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Quadrivium</span> is the name of the book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said Powerful Teaching should be discussed in each department.  Teachers need to share what is invigorating to them.  This is what fuels the fire of the teachers and their students.  We need to be able to do this.</p>
<p>&#8211;David feels there is no time to implement changes.  He would like time to innovate changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Everyone thanked Joseph for bringing up this topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked everyone to look at the back of the Priority Page—this is from the PTSA meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Parents want the College Counseling Position restored.  Change the word “replace.”  10 parents and 1 student attended the meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked how many counselors are bilingual—everyone except one.  Many are Chinese speaking, Lily knows Spanish.  Ray said Armando (para) is paid to translate Spanish, and he can be called upon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph told of a student who has 2 ethnic backgrounds and the scantron only recalled one answer.  This survey was data driven only and we can put that in the directions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said it would be good to get information about the survey ahead of time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti said we have a teacher in the school who teaches AP Statistics and can compose surveys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:30am.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said that we need to come up with 10 priorities.  We can also combine some of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said many of them can be enhanced by small class sizes.  Marcus added that it is highly unlikely in the district.  Discussion followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Room sharing and no reduction in teachers are in direct conflict.  Tony said at times teachers choose to leave the school and then we may not replace them.</p>
<p>&#8211;Room sharing was eliminated.</p>
<p>&#8211;Some items do not involve money.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about taking money from Professional Development.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus suggested reducing class size as part of 9<sup>th</sup> grade transition.  Reducing class sizes fits with many priorities.</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat suggested combining the collaboration ideas.</p>
<p>&#8211;Suggestions from some would like to have another counselor.</p>
