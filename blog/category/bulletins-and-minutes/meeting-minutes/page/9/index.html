<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Heads Meeting</span></strong></p>
<p align="right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>5/31/12</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 11:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus welcomed the new members, Lisa Warnke and Douglas Page.  Then everyone introduced themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Heads</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Department Head Return Dates</p>
<p>&#8211;At the last meeting this was under discussion.  The return date will be August 13<sup>th</sup>.  The mornings will be for everyone to work on their own and then there will be meetings in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8211;Department Heads will work 2 days prior to school and 3 days after school.</p>
<p>&#8211;It has not been determined yet if there will be department heads in the fall.  No one has received letters yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned a Grievance Meeting next Wednesday at 3pm, 555 Franklin Street, Room 306.  Joseph and Michelle are mentioned by name in a letter he read to Susan Solomon concerning all department heads.             Joseph encouraged everyone to attend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Calendar</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie mentioned that she and Tony will be working on the Galileo calendar for next year.  She asked members to give them any dates they wanted on the calendar.</p>
<p>&#8211;Freshmen Orientation will be the Friday before classes begin.  PE uniforms will be sold at that time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug Page asked for the end of the marking periods.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph wants the Winter and Spring concerts on the calendar.</p>
<p>&#8211;Date for Back to School Night should be on the calendar.</p>
<p>&#8211;September 20 or 27 will be the ELD Picnic/Team Building Activity.</p>
<p>&#8211;Human Rights Exhibit should be between STAR and AP testing.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen asked for the CELTD testing dates.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned the concept of unbalanced semesters.  In the spring semester, there is STAR testing, 4 Furlough Days and a week of finals, which he felt made this semester so rushed.  Kathleen said the first semester seemed really rushed.  Joseph felt we should eliminate the Final Exam week.  He also thought we should have 3 block days for finals, and have teachers give 1-hour finals only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David said some teachers want that time to do their grades, clean their rooms, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we want to get students ready to go to college and the finals are part of that.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said we should have a policy about finals as many do not give them.  She asked if this is a sight-based decision.</p>
<p>&#8211;The Furlough Days are not listed on the Instructional Calendar.  The district says it is 4 for next year.  If the state tax initiative does not pass, the amount of furlough days will be 9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about CPT for next year.  Marcus said we need to do the PD plan first.  We will go with the 2 days—Wednesday and Thursday.  She asked for the Cluster Time.  Doug also asked for more CPT for the clusters.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said with the Cluster Time there must be agendas with a focus and a goal.  We need to be efficient with the time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said that most teachers teach more than one subject so they are involved in 2 clusters.</p>
<p>&#8211;David had a suggestion on how to target both the admin requirements and the cluster activity and meet administrative requirements.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said he prefers the meetings to be longer than 1 hour.  The old 2 hour meetings were much more productive,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Final Survey Results</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph passed out the final survey results.</p>
<p>&#8211;Most preferred the 5-minute passing period.</p>
<p>&#8211;Most people preferred 2 homerooms per week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Most people wanted to keep 15 minutes of SSR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;The survey also included the teacher comments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David mentioned that the teachers who travel do have a challenge to get to the next classroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the student survey results were not clear.  54% preferred the 5-minute period.  We will look at the student survey and make the final decision.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked about the SSR.  David said school literacy is a huge issue.  Research shows that it is very effective in literacy.  Literacy affects all disciplines.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said students like structure.  It happens every block day for each period.  Ethan said he requires books in PE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said every classroom should have an SSR library.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa suggested having SSR during homeroom. She suggested making homeroom longer.</p>
<p>&#8211;G-House TV will continue next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said we use homeroom for class level assemblies as well.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said that Homeroom is not supposed to be an additional class for the teacher.  Joseph said this is also a union issue, so homeroom is not a class.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said homeroom is a chance to talk to the kids and homeroom stays together 4 years.  It is a bonding issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Kelli made a comment about the attendance strips and homeroom, which Joseph read to the group.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen mentioned the citizenship policy and Katie said that there are teachers who do not enforce this policy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug talked about private schools, where the teacher just marks the attendance strips and does the grades.  The absences are calculated by the school and then citizenship grades are assigned accordingly.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise talked about what the Deans’ Office puts out about citizenship.  She followed it and it worked.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said he thought many teachers might forget about doing the citizenship.</p>
<p>&#8211;New teachers may not know about the citizenship policy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus thanked Joe and Stan for doing the survey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise asked about old editions of books in boxes.  Katie said the warehouse will come and collect, but they need a list.  Put the books outside where you keep the books.  Please email Katie if you have books to get rid of and where they will be.</p>
<p>&#8211;Consumables can be recycled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen has lots of SSR books and magazines.  Katie asked her to send that out in an email in the fall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked if our entire faculty will be in place at the start of school.  He also asked about the budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said his department has their books on rollers.  Please do not take these books or carts.  The carts are labeled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we will use the entire 2<sup>nd</sup> floor for summer school, and the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor in the Van Ness Building.  Some classrooms are a mess right now and have to be cleaned prior to summer school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Promethean Boards—Marcus encouraged the group to make the best use of them.  If some teachers are not using them, give them to others in your department.  Kathleen said we need training.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat asked about tomorrow.  Marcus asked the members to stop in and see him tomorrow.  He will be here until 3pm tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:55pm.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>5/17/12</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Balanced Score Card</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed information on the Balanced Score Card.  This is a living document.  He asked for feedback from the group.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus will get into the WASC report over the summer and see what else we need to address.</p>
<p>&#8211;We need to go into next school year knowing what we need to do.  The first two sections are over view and data review.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned the Core Curriculum the district is putting together.  She mentioned what the district is doing with the Standards Maps.  At this point we do not know what this is.  Tony referred to her page 8b.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony said the district does not have clarity about what this will look like.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said they are not using the Common Core to design the Common Curriculum for English.</p>
<p>&#8211;Part A concerns readiness and challenges.  This is followed by Next Steps.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick mentioned the lack of funds for professional development.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said they will be dropping the CLA’s next year.  He said this was mentioned in the WAD from last week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;ELD Current Status—we list what we are doing now.  Some of this is ELD department and the rest is other departments.  Language Objectives are listed as well.  We are not doing the BBC school-wide so we still have to address having a language objective in each classroom.</p>
<p>&#8211;Vocabulary development is spelled out on page 9. Brick word and mortar words are the same.</p>
<p>&#8211;Section 3 of the Lau Plan will be studied next year.  Tony mentioned some training that will occur this summer with Q-tell.  Jen Fong will help with PD next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Special Ed is the next section.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti asked about statistics on AA and Latino students.  Ray addressed this and indicated what the numbers meant.  Ray said he would explain any of the “Next Steps.”</p>
<p>&#8211;Administrators must attend the IEPs and administrators must arrange coverage for teachers who need to attend the IEPs.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray expressed the challenges of scheduling the IEPs.  He also said there is a box to excuse administrators and teachers on the IEP—full exclusion or partial, depending on which box is checked.</p>
<p>&#8211;Proportional Representation—Ray discussed this and said we have talked about this before.  For 30 students, 3 or 4 Special Ed students is the max.</p>
<p>__Michelle said this has come up before—she would like some PD on how to arrange this.  Ray said his department would be happy to do this.  Marcus said he would like to know from general ed teachers where we should start with PD.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said the teachers who are delivering resource services, they should be in the classroom, not in room 352.  It should be a 100% commitment.</p>
<p>&#8211;Some in the group said they do not feel comfortable asking the resource teachers why they can’t come to class when they say they can’t.</p>
<p>&#8211;Increased administrative monitoring of how Special Ed resources are allocated in classrooms.</p>
<p>&#8211;Resource also includes the paraprofessionals.  Ray said we have some of the best paras in the district.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said that the Inclusion model has only been pushed for the last several years.  He mentioned our new AP, Lisa Warnke, and her experience in this area.  He is happy to have her on board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Section IV</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle wants other departments listed besides English.  Marcus said this is a school-wide activity.  This has also been discussed in the SSC meetings.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we need to add more to Closing the Achievement Gap.  We are having an extremely hard time with our Latino students.  Some of the students in 9<sup>th</sup> grade are drinking, etc.  We have12% now Latino students in the 9<sup>th</sup> grade and this will double next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick mentioned conflicts of getting the dens together.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus mentioned that the English Department has a small number of teachers working with the 9<sup>th</sup> graders.  Marti said it is the same in the Math Department.</p>
<p>&#8211;David suggested that more teachers teach 9<sup>th</sup> grade so there are more teachers available for discussions and improvements.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned a former professional development on different cultures—Sharroky Hollie  and how helpful that was.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he became very expensive very fast.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony referred everyone to page 16 and cultural responsive teaching.</p>
<p>&#8211;Explore dens and define dens.  Are they useful?</p>
<p>&#8211;Look for opportunities in the Master Schedule and CPT for 9<sup>th</sup> grade teachers to collaborate.</p>
<p>&#8211;Look for opportunities in extra-curricular after school activities.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said Kristy Morrison and Doug Page said at the UBC meeting yesterday they would like to fund raise to save Futurama.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica talked about the SAP meetings.  This helps with the 9<sup>th</sup> grade transition students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray requested .7 Adv.  Algebra and  .7 Chemistry on the schedule (item deck).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Accountability (page 17)—</p>
<p>School Climate—Jessica would like to add Wellness to this area.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray talked about the Move-Up Assembly and why some of the students wanted to leave as all the scholarships went to Asian students.  Michelle said we should include events like sports teams, athletic teams, Talent Show winners, etc.  David Barrios said we should revisit how we plan this assembly, to recognize a broad range of achievement.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus mentioned increasing attendance in class.  He will take more of a hands-on approach to this next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick mentioned teachers helping with the hall sweeps next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica wanted to add the SST meetings to outcomes of Measurable Outcomes.</p>
<p>&#8211;The PTSA came up with increased communication, reflection tool for students and teachers on how students are feeling in class about the instruction and one more.  We do need to communicate more with the parents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle wanted to mention a priority of small class sizes.  If we get more students can we hire more teachers?  Marcus said yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Academic Honesty</p>
<p>&#8211;We will table this item until next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said she caught 2 students cheating yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti told of students taking photos of AP exams with their cell phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Homeroom Survey Results</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph told of his experiences in doing this survey—his first.</p>
<p>&#8211;The passing period time (5 or 7 minutes) was not clear.</p>
<p>&#8211;Most preferred the weekly homerooms.</p>
<p>&#8211;SSR overwhelmingly retained—most wanted 15 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8211;69 people voted.</p>
<p>&#8211;CPT 2times a week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph will revisit the survey to prepare the results.</p>
<p>&#8211;We need more staff to fill out the survey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Head Meeting</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></p>
<p>I.          Contingency Plans for Fall</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat talked about all the details that department heads handle.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he can’t see the district eliminating the department heads.  The principals express this to the district.</p>
<p>&#8211;As of now Department Heads have the 4<sup>th</sup> period free.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said there has to be a formal agreement for next fall to have the department heads report to school 2 days prior to the teachers arrival.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan said the district will put those duties on the responsibility of the administration.</p>
<p>&#8211;If the department head positions are not retained, the former DHs will have another class to teach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Department Head Duties 5/30 and 5/31 and 6/1.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked everyone to plan to return for these 2 days.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle would like to use the 2-3 days at their own discretion.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus would like to meet for an hour on 5/31 at 11:00am.</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked if there would be 2 full days of meetings.  We will do a 3-2—Friday and Monday meetings and Tuesday a free day.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said 2 days of meetings would be difficult as it is hard to get things done.</p>
<p>&#8211;Suggestion was made to have meetings in the am and work allowed in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:50am.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Student and Teacher Voices</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph shared conversations with students about the STAR tests.  Joseph mentioned that there are 5 different versions of the test and the questions are in different order on each of the versions.  He talked about how excited these students were about solving the math problems on the test, during their lunch hour.</p>
<p>&#8211;He talked about the RIP tombstones they made for the band program being cut.  One student asked him about the cuts.  One student said her brother was going be a Gal student next year and band is the only thing he is good at.  He told of other students who were upset about the end of the band.</p>
<p>&#8211;Then Joseph read the speech that he read to the parents and students in the auditorium at the Open House last night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Tonight, we are witnessing the last performance of the Band on this stage.</p>
<p>Every other spring concert that I have helped produce in my 18 years at Galileo has been a time of celebration. This year’s concert is different.  This is a time for mourning and sadness.  87 years ago, the Galileo Band and Galileo Piano program was born.  For 87 years, the music program has contributed to the culture and fabric of Galileo.</p>
<p>We will never hear the fight song played at Song and Yell.</p>
<p>Future graduating seniors will not be called to the stage to receive their diplomas with the clarion call of the trumpets playing the opening strains of “Pomp and Circumstance.”</p>
<p>Graduating seniors will not be able to sing the Galileo Hymn with the Band.</p>
<p>Beginning piano students will no longer be able to touch the genius of great composers like Bach, Beethoven and Mozart.</p>
<p>Incoming 9<sup>th</sup> grade students will not be able to become a part of this tradition that has been in existence since 1925!</p>
<p>Tonight, the work of a long line of dedicated, hard working music teachers comes to a crashing halt.</p>
<p>There is a chance that this may not come to pass.  Every other time that the Arts have faced a catastrophic demise, money has been found.  Budgets have been restored.  The needs and desires of students have been realized.</p>
<p>We are here to celebrate the band’s long and powerful life.  Thank you to all musicians, parents, teachers, and administrators who have helped support music at Galileo.</p>
<p>The world will little note, nor long remember what I say tonight, but it can never forget the music that has been made here. Our job is to be dedicated to the unfinished work that they who performed here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is for us to be dedicated to the great task remaining before us—to preserve the long tradition of music at Galileo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked if the SSC has discussed priorities for restoring programs.  Marcus said this would happen at their next meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick thanked Joseph for sharing his thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said that everyone needs to know about items such as this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus is in conversation with Rob Daniels about this and restoring the position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Academic Honesty</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Open House Feedback</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat said some in his department question the need for all teachers to be present.</p>
<p>&#8211;He did mention that a big wave of students and parents came by to see their display</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he agreed, but he did not know how to say who should be here and who should be excused.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise thought about teachers who travel far by public transportation or have young children.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti recalled a year in the past where only several teachers from each department were asked to be present.</p>
<p>&#8211;David suggested doing it as a department choice.  He also mentioned that this used to be more oriented to our current students, but it has become more of an 8<sup>th</sup> grade event.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph felt that the tour groups should be spaced farther apart.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph also advocated for a return to having the Fall Open House moved to week 10 so we can distribute report cards to parents—that brought many more parents to the event.  He also mentioned that some parents have students in more than 1 school and they cannot attend all the events when they are all in the same week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica shared her thoughts about the event.  She did not get as many parents as she was prepared for.  She said the feeling was chaotic and felt it did not showcase the amazing programs at Galileo.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said they tell the parents who are registering their students about the Open House.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick mentioned that if Department Chairs were the ones required to attend, they might not be available for a CPT if they are given comp time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said you cannot use where people live or how many children they have as a means of excusing teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;David felt it is better when the parents are free flowing and not in groups.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica volunteered to help see how we can change this event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Final Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;It is now posted on the Web Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         2012/2013 Bell Schedule</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David wanted to discuss the homerooms and passing times.</p>
<p>&#8211;Some teachers want homeroom every week.</p>
<p>&#8211;He also said there should be discussion on the passing periods.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy asked Patrick if there was a vote last year on the bell schedule.  Patrick said it was on the CPT—1 day or 2 for early release, which affects the bus schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked if Patrick could have the UBC put out a survey.  Patrick said the UBC would review the survey.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said her teachers felt the teachers know the students better for testing when we have a weekly homeroom.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben said for scheduling purposes it seems to be better to have consistency and have the homeroom weekly.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked Patrick to do another survey.  Patrick said the UBC will work on contractual issues.  He also said the UBC is not a paid position.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti thought the UBC was involved in creating this year’s schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben said we have a Leadership Team, a UBC and an SSC and no one wants to take the lead on this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked how many questions should be on the survey.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked for feedback.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said his department did not want to have homeroom only once a month.  Denise said her department felt the same.</p>
<p>&#8211;Bettie recalled for the group the days of Galileo being an II/USP school with low-test scores.  The Homeroom was reinstated then so that teachers could build relationships with their students which would help students want to do better on the tests.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked Stan to do a survey with 2 questions—Weekly Homeroom or not?  5 or 7 minute passing period?</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph is in favor or the weekly homeroom and a 7-minute passing period as the bathrooms are really crowded and 5 minutes is not long enough.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested we also survey the teachers about the length of SSR.  He also said that we need to be flexible.  Galileo is an organic being and we need to revisit the ground rules.</p>
<p>&#8211;David offered some insight into why we are having this discussion now.  He thought we did not make a decision on the homerooms and the passing periods.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus is happy with what makes the teachers and students happy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise suggested homeroom on one of the block days.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked if the survey should be on email or hard copy.  Joseph said he would help do a Google doc.  Joseph said it could be done during CPT next week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we would have to have plans for things to do during homeroom.</p>
<p>&#8211;Bettie talked about the many bell schedules that need to be programmed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Build On</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus introduced Chad Zibelman from Build On.</p>
<p>&#8211;Chad said they have been here since 2008, they are a national organization and their focus is to enhance education and empower youth.  This is worldwide.  This year they are an after school program; in previous years they were a lunchtime program.</p>
<p>&#8211;He mentioned that a Galileo student in this program was on the national news last week. One focus is community service.</p>
<p>&#8211;There are two full time employees in the schools to run the program.</p>
<p>&#8211;Chad would like to have a space on campus.  He would like to look at partnering with an academy or program at Galileo.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise asked if he has talked with Summerfund.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked if Build On was going to work with our groups who already do Community Service.  Chad said they would like to get other students involved as well.</p>
<p>&#8211;Chad said they are now under the umbrella of Futurama.  They are at Leadership now and they will start full time in the fall.  The organization builds schools in foreign countries and gives the students the opportunity to travel abroad and help build schools in foreign countries.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph expressed his feelings on how positive this type of work is.  He mentioned Christmas in April from the past.  He is in favor of building community service here at Galileo.</p>
<p>&#8211;Karin said she has parents who want activities for their children during the summer. She expressed her concerns to keep this open and not partner with a pathway, as that limits the student participation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII.      Master Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said they continue to work on the schedule.  This year there is more data from the district than they have ever had before.  Beginning on May 13 we will get another 100 9<sup>th</sup> graders.  We have 430 now committed to Galileo—530 were admitted.  We will get more money.  We may be facing some changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said they might have to change their department schedules, as they did not get another room.  If you have any ideas on rooms, please let David know.  He will have to change the singleton/doubleton situation.  Nancy and David will work on this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said her last day is tomorrow.  Things will continue to be influx.  Nancy is training Lauren and Nancy will keep in touch with Lauren.  Marcus and Tony have done the master schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Many items will affect the Master Schedule and there will be changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise discussed conversations with parents about 9<sup>th</sup> graders taking world languages.  Nancy said we do not have the capacity to offer world languages to 9<sup>th</sup> graders.  They do have to take the College and Career course during 9<sup>th</sup> grade.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti discussed the transition with her retiring and Doug Page taking over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph wanted to discuss the extra days for department heads.  This year we did 2 days before school and 3 days after school.  She mentioned how Vicki handled this in the past.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said since we will have Summer School at Galileo, then department heads could come in during summer school to work on the schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said they would talk about this in their administrative meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said that there was talk of Nancy moving to C &amp; I.  At this point that won’t happen and the new position is for C &amp; I.  Round 2 of interviews will be tomorrow.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise expressed her hope that we get someone who knows about high school curriculum.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle talked about the CPT and how much of it has not been productive.  She mentioned that we have not had cluster meetings.  She would like to see more of this in the CPT schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray misses the 2-hour meetings.  He said an hour is not long enough to get major tasks done.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said it is important for teachers to share their best practice with their colleagues.  He thought these meetings should be interdepartmental.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti felt that we need to know ahead of time when meetings are scheduled—weeks ahead of time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti suggested doing a survey or room need, ratios.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned rumors in the district about eliminating department head positions and AP preps.  Then we will need more rooms.</p>
<p>&#8211;David felt we should minimize teachers having to move during the school day.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti will look at the ratios. Michelle and David will help her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked everyone to thank Richard McDowell for his hard work on winning a 2-year grant worth $50,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Head Agenda</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.  Balanced Score Card Review</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed some current information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Item tabled until next meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Professional Development Day Feedback</p>
<p>&#8211;His department appreciated the flexibility of the day and that teachers could catch up as being very valuable.</p>
<p>&#8211;Others agreed.  Many said it was the best PD day they’ve ever had.  They had time to get things accomplished.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said the best PD days are those that are on-site.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti said her department really enjoyed the flexibility.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus thanked everyone for the feedback.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray learned that IEP meetings are not optional and IEP teachers and administrators must attend the meeting from beginning to end unless a box is check on the form that they will only attend part of the time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said it is difficult when teachers have to attend an IEP on their prep time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the district is going to work on making IEPs more streamlined.</p>
<p>&#8211;It is an administrator’s duty to find coverage for teachers who have to attend an IEP during their class time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said that IEPs should never take more than an hour.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said all of his teachers will check the box saying “Part of” for teachers and administrators attending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the agenda for the department heads 2 days prior to start of school.  The department heads need time outside of meetings to get work done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked for input for the survey for homerooms and passing times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 12:25pm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          ELL IOC Report</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus introduced Jen Fong who will give us the ELL  IOC report.  She discussed the unannounced visit earlier this semester, March 19, 2012.  She mentioned the Lau case and said that the courts keep finding us out of compliance.  This is the Internal Oversight Committee to make sure we are serving the ELL students.  This group is composed partly of assistant superintendents.</p>
<p>&#8211;She distributed information and explained its development.  The feedback from the visit should produce reflection and then growth.</p>
<p>&#8211;She mentioned that this is the 6<sup>th</sup> report in the district this year.  In the past there has not been a lot of support for the ELL students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked for the definition of a Language Objective.  Jen used the terms compare and contrast.  She mentioned that they would be happy to do some professional development in this area.  She used the term graphic organizers.  She wants the students to have academic English.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;She came for the review with her team and others, totaling 12 individuals.  They visited as many places as they could.  They talked to non-classroom staff and students.  They still need to talk to the parents.</p>
<p>&#8211;It was clear that everyone was aware of the ELL students.  Newcomers have 0-1 year in US schools.  Developing ELs have 2-4 years in US schools.  Long Term ELs have 5+ years.</p>
<p>&#8211;In classes where there were very few ELs, they did not see as much strategies for these students as in classes where there were many Els.  She said it is mandated that teachers use SADIE strategies and that is why all teachers are mandated to have a CLAD.  Student to student activities and graphic organizers are some of the things they were looking for.  Do we see visuals?</p>
<p>In lecture classes, the ELs have a harder time absorbing the material.  They like to see a variety of strategies that help students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Please move ELD .7-.8 to regular English so that they will be eligible for UC entrance.  She sees that happening at Galileo.  We do not want to mix Newcomers with Long Term ELs, even if they have the same CELT scores.  The Long Term ELs do not take the CELT seriously. Now that more ELs are being included in the mainstream, we need to use strategies to reach them.  She addressed the difference in the Long Term ELs’ speaking and writing skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked if separation of the ELs and the ELAs in mainstream classes is important.  Jen discussed the differences between Long Term ELs and other students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said many folks are not clear on the difference between .6 and .8 classes.  She asked for more PD in this area.  Jen said they are eager to do this.</p>
<p>&#8211;July 23-27, 2012 are dates for training over the summer.  Those who attend will follow up when they return to the site.  There is a $2,000 stipend for doing this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jen said they would come to the site and design training that would work here.  She said you will see immediate results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked if the district will make it easier to identify the different students.</p>
<p>She said Data Director does it now.  She hopes it will be on SIS shortly.</p>
<p>&#8211;.6 in English means something different than in Math, Science and Social Studies.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jen encouraged everyone to attend some of the trainings.  She also encouraged everyone to ask for help with strategies.</p>
<p>&#8211;She said that we could get picked again next year for the IOC visit and she hopes they would see growth at that time.</p>
<p>&#8211;She encouraged increasing student-to-student interaction.  This is more engaging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed information on the Balanced Score Card.  Please look at the ELL section and we will discuss it next meeting.  Do we want to do these activities by department or school-wide?</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus also distributed some information from the last WASC review to remind and refresh our thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8211;He said our EL students and our Newcomer students are extremely motivated to be successful.  We are doing good things at Galileo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben asked if we did well in this review and will we come under additional scrutiny. Marcus said there are areas for improvement, but we are doing a lot of things well.  He spoke about using more visuals next year to help our EL students.  Kathleen mentioned they are making posters to use the academic language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned concerns with the re-designation of students that can cause elimination of some skill sets. Kathleen touched on the criteria students need to move to the next level.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said there should be this information can be given to al faculty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         CAHSEE Results</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony passed out the results and gave credit to Jonathan Ring for creating the document.  He explained the document and highlighted the gains.  He felt the overall numbers were great.  Special Ed students are included in this report.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben commented on the zip code break down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said CSU is going to start using the CST tests for Math and English placement, instead of the EAP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Common Formative Assessments</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;April 23<sup>rd</sup> is a PD day and this is the entire agenda.  We want to see one each semester.</p>
<p>&#8211;Teachers can attend other PDs off site, but the CFAs must be completed prior to 4/23.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy brought up lunch and the fact that many wanted to go off campus for lunch.  Lunch is on your own.</p>
<p>&#8211;There will be a short faculty meeting in the morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Budget</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we submitted a budget initially by balancing the budget by not using the mandated 2% for operating costs.  We wanted to use the projected AP money for that.  It was turned down.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus, Karin and, Katie worked on a revision.  They used categorical funds for the counselors.  We have an ELD retirement, so we did not fill that position.  If get an influx of Newcomers we will have to ask for more funds for these students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy gave department heads the sections based on what we have now.  Things change over the summer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked how many 9<sup>th</sup> graders were assigned here and how many have signed up?  As of yesterday there were 130 who have not committed to Galileo.  520-550 were assigned.  TAs phoned the homes and some parents did not realize they had to come in for enrollment.  Many Latinos did not realize they had to come to the school to accept.  Only 7 of the 130 said they were going to go to another school.  Karin Lau will call those families.</p>
<p>&#8211;Round 2 for enrollment will start soon.  It will begin on May 13<sup>th</sup>.  Round 3 will be in the summer time.  Nancy said we should have more students that we expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Master Schedule—singleton/doubleton meeting tomorrow 4° in 102.  There will be another meeting on Thursday of the STAR testing week if we do not finish.  Nancy asked everyone to check the Google Doc and enter the singletons and doubletons.</p>
<p>&#8211;Try to have one class of each grade level in every period.  Let Marcus and Nancy know if there are too many 1<sup>st</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> period preps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus mentioned student placement.  ELL students are supposed to start and end the day with those support classes.  This is a WASC recommendation.  Nancy said the ELD classes are on the even periods and the labs are on the odd periods.  Kathleen said they tried to have the students in the ELD community at the beginning and the end of the day.  He encouraged each department to review the WASC and the Balanced Score Card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;FRISCO Day is tomorrow.  There are students turning in last minute field trip slips.  The district is providing more busses.  Those students who are not going need to show up for classes.  Anyone who does not come to school or to FRISCO Day will not be allowed to go to Prom.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben discussed the severe consequence for this particular day if a student cuts versus any other day.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said parents might have a valid argument against this punishment.  He mentioned recent articles in the <span style="text-decoration: underline">SF Chronicle</span> that are disturbing about CTS at Mission and O’Connell.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph felt the day was poorly scheduled—on the last day of the grading period.  He felt the administration should protest this schedule and say it does not work for our teachers.  Marcus said there was no opportunity to say this.  Marcus felt that some teachers felt they were done with grading by the last day of the grading period.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said it is earlier this year and the district wants to wait until students get accepted to college.  Some teachers felt it was too close to AP testing.  Suggestion was made to do it during CST time.  Chaperones then become a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Bettie distributed the Draft of the April 25<sup>th</sup> Open House for Karin Lau.  Marcus said there was a suggestion to offer extra credit if families come.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said the kids go from room to room on the Scavenger Hunt and do not ask any questions about programs, etc.  Teachers and parents felt it was a waste of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the parents felt the number of questions should be limited—students can pick the questions they are interested in.  Marcus will send an email to everyone with what the parents suggested.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy suggested parents and students should visit departments.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said it should be student run, which would be more interesting to the in-coming students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise asked if all teachers were required to attend.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said some parents try to monopolize the teachers.  This is not a time for teacher conferences.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben felt we should have a clear statement of purpose.  Then we can figure out the activities.</p>
<p>&#8211;David felt we should be showcasing the first floor and have that open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said Wednesday, April 18<sup>th</sup> at 2:15pm there will be a School Loop Training in 102 for submitting grades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:40am.</p>

<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:05am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Budget</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie distributed the most current budget sheet.  This consists of input from this group and the SSC.</p>
<p>&#8211;The district is adding to the librarian position and the nurse.  We are cutting .5 para position and .2 clerical.  We are moving .4 from the TSA to ELD.  We are cutting .6 from AVID and moving it to English.  English we are cutting .8, offset by .6 AVID and .2 Journalism. College Career/Health—cut .4, move .2 to Social Studies and only 9<sup>th</sup> graders.  PE is cut 1.4., offset by .4 TSA. We are cutting IT prep.  We are cutting .4 from ELD. Math—no change.  Peer Resource no change. Science—additional sections, no ASB prep, $2K stipend, additional students.  Social Studies add .2 from CC/Health.  VAPA—cut.4 fewer students (A-G). World Language&#8211;no change.  Yearbook/Journalism combined class.</p>
<p>&#8211;We will be keeping drama.</p>
<p>&#8211;3.6 % cut in Certificated classroom positions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie discussed operating costs.  We have a total operating budget of $142,293.00 for the coming year.  Last year we had $263,105 from the WSF.</p>
<p>&#8211;We are getting a 6.9% cut, but only a 3.6 certificated classroom cut.  We have an 8.8% cut in classified positions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked about PE credit for sports.  Next year students will not get credit.  He also asked about the 138 students that have to take PE because they did not pass the content standards.  Marcus mentioned the administration has discussed having an after school program for these students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben mentioned that some of these students were involved in academies and other programs and relied on sports credit for PE to complete their requirements.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we are out of compliance with this and we are not supposed to do this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan has to test these students and if they do not pass, then they have to take PE.</p>
<p>&#8211;Those certificated cuts—teachers are entitled to a 1.0 position in the district.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked about ROTC.  There will be 1 position, and we pay .5.  If outside funding happens, then we may have 2 positions.  Leo is working on his PE credential.  We are planning for 150 students in ROTC.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked about enrollment numbers for ROTC in all grades.  He asked if students are arbitrarily placed in ROTC and then they can opt out.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said a lot of these numbers will change in the fall.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan talked about the fact that periods 5 and 6 are heavy in PE and the morning classes are lighter.  We need to balance the classes.  1<sup>st</sup> period and 6th period classes have the most students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick questioned cutting .2 from social studies and cutting 1 .4 from PE.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the PE classes are small.  Ethan said the class size should be 37.  Marcus said 37 is an average number for class sizes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said there were cuts all over the place.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said the members of the SSC refused last night to sign off on the budget.  It was submitted and will have a letter stating objections to being cut this year.  Out of 17 high schools in SF, our funding is 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said the letter is currently being drafted and this group will get a copy of it.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said this is not an easy process and he thanked everyone for their input and participation.  He thanked Katie for her hard work.  Jonathan Ring and Mele did an excellent job as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Vending Machines</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie has been approached by a company to put in vending machines at Galileo stocked with healthy foods.  Wallenberg, Mission and Gateway have them.</p>
<p>&#8211;We would get money for them—50-50.</p>
<p>&#8211;We can decide where the vending machines are placed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Last time we had them they were located in ROTC and kids were cutting classes and hanging out there.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned the history of having a Coke machine in the Band Room and all the problems that came with it.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray mentioned that vending machines are quicker than leaving campus.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus felt that if we do it, we should do it ourselves and keep all the money.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben felt the students should initiate the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Student Activity Dates</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie emailed this to everyone and she got some appreciation.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said April 13<sup>th</sup> is Frisco Day for Seniors re: college.</p>
<p>&#8211;ASB assembly will be Thursday 4/12.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested having a regular 1-6 schedule and having a double 4<sup>th</sup> or double 6<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle suggested the assembly on Monday prior to STAR testing.  STAR testing always starts on a Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie asked if we could do the voting during the periods in the afternoon after the morning STAR tests.  Everyone agreed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Assembly is Monday April 16<sup>th</sup> for ASB elections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Open House</p>
<p>&#8211;Counseling Office has sent information out to prospective students saying it is April 25<sup>th</sup>.  Incoming 9<sup>th</sup> graders have been given this date.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph wanted to have it the same evening as the Spring Concert.</p>
<p>&#8211;Registration for incoming 9<sup>th</sup> graders was arbitrarily moved up a week.  Nancy said the notice from the district was late.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph would like to coordinate these two events in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Staff Appreciation</p>
<p>&#8211;Thursday, May 3<sup>rd</sup> is the date Gayline is proposing.  It will be the Faculty Meeting time—switched from Wednesday to Thursday.  Wednesday will be for department meetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Master Schedule Update</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy told the group that the counselors are now inputting the information that the teachers have sent.  We should be able to figure out how many sections for each course the week after Spring Break.  They are trying to do some comparison data.</p>
<p>&#8211;She mentioned that there will be some blanks in student schedules in the beginning—mostly to show the district we need a lot of help.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we will not double up on science classes to see what we are working with and to show the district the bare bones schedules.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said some of the schedules for juniors and seniors would only have 4 classes.  Joseph asked how they could graduate if they could not have a full schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;This is a long process and we will see what the bare bones looks like.  Hopefully the district will release more funds and we can expand.</p>
<p>&#8211;9<sup>th</sup> graders for the fall are registering now until April 13<sup>th</sup>.  The district has put in 532 9<sup>th</sup> graders.  That means more money for us as originally we were projected at 450 students.  The counseling office will call those who have not come to register.  They will also do some outreach.  That would mean $4,279.00 per student.  That would mean over $400,000 more money.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked about the demographics.  Tony said 49% Chinese, 25% Latino and all other ethnicities were not higher than 10%.</p>
<p>&#8211;The real $$ amount comes after the 10 day count.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said there are also upper class students who do not return in the fall.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the singleton/doubleton meeting—April 12<sup>th</sup> is the target date.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren will take over Nancy’s position in the Counseling Office while Nancy is on maternity leave and Tony will be helping with the Master Schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII.      Copy Machines in 307</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise talked of an experience she had several weeks ago and she talked about a project where someone copied a book—23 originals, 55 copies.</p>
<p>&#8211;Please remind your department members to use the Riso for large volumes.</p>
<p>&#8211;The Xerox machine in 307 is broken.</p>
<p>&#8211;We are trying to keep students out of copy machines.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked about codes for each person.  Joseph mentioned that teachers would give their codes to their students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Large printing jobs can be sent to the district office now, but that won’t happen next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti mentioned in the past each department head talked to the teachers in their department who make lots of copies.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben suggested that unattended big jobs be seized and brought to the main office for pick-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VIII.     School Safety Concerns</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise mentioned that we have no School Crossing Signs by our school.  There</p>
<p>Should be on every corner.  We will put in a work order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IX.        Star Testing Procedures</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti wanted to make sure that everybody knows what they are to do as far as picking up, dropping off, etc.  All ducks should be in a row.  Vicki did it for the last 15 years.  She would like to see everything spelled out way ahead of time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony did the STAR testing for 2 years at Aptos.  The first faculty meeting after Spring Break we will go over the procedures.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony will try to replicate as much as possible what has been done in the past.</p>
<p>&#8211;Our usual substitutes will be on hand to help.</p>
<p>&#8211;We will use Room 253 for the headquarters.</p>
<p>&#8211;The group asked for the bell schedule for STAR test.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise brought up the fact that teachers who are assigned as support should be ready to relive the regular teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti asked to be somewhat free so she can handle the problems with Math department encounters during the testing.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said it is important for teachers to read the directions, as they are different every year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti suggested an information session just prior to the STAR testing so everyone has all the information.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said it is important to follow the script that comes with the test.</p>
<p>&#8211;Karin talked about the Chinese Immersion schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat suggested the relief schedule be kept within the department.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie suggested that teachers be assigned as a team to give the test and do a 50-50 job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IX.        Common Formative Assessments</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he hoped everyone was almost done with this. April 23<sup>rd</sup> is the target date.  This will be department time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony said the most recent CLA’s are now in Data Director.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray talked about the problem when the pre-slugged answer sheets are not ready for the students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:30am.</p>

<p><strong>A note from Principal Blacksher:</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The minutes below reflect our leadership team&#8217;s grappling with extraordinary budgetary challenges. All of us &#8211; administrators and education staff &#8211; are acting with transparency and collaboration. At times, conversations can become difficult. Difficult conversations are sometimes necessary and sometimes useful. However, reported only through meeting minutes, misinterpretations and misrepresentations can occur. I urge you to read carefully, react with patience and understanding, and ask for clarification of anything reported in our minutes. We are all in this together. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 11:20am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nancy reminded the group to turn in spreadsheets by Thursday on where the students chose to go to classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said he has a separate spreadsheet for each teacher.  Can he put each teacher on a separate sheet?  Nancy said take more time and put them all on one sheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Budget</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed a new budget sheet.  They took supplies away and put in another FTE.  The actual costs are not on the sheet.  The average teacher salary went down and it reflected on this sheet.  We can add back a librarian, no change, the paras, TSA,  and they took out the counselor.</p>
<p>&#8211;Avid is cut from 8-5 sections, ELD cut of 1, English cut  2 with one going back in, so a cut of 1, PE, cut of 2, VAPA,</p>
<p>World Language cut .6.  ROTC stays at a .5.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked how the Army will do with 1 ROTC instructor.  Marcus said unless the SSC thinks otherwise, we will do this and probably go back on probation with only 1 instructor.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if this a proposal or talking points.  Marcus said these are talking points.  The budget is due March 23<sup>rd</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A.         English</p>
<p>&#8211;Michele mentioned the 24% of seniors ready for college.  She mentioned the API scores—37% comes from English.  She asked why we would cut this important department.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said one of our focuses is on literacy and restoring the librarian meets this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned the larger class sizes will have an impact on learning and the scores.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said we have many more electives than other high schools.  He discussed the scores.  He mentioned the size of the Math department and the fact that the lower level class sizes are kept small.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said Science has an average class size that is higher than both English and Math.</p>
<p>&#8211;Many of the elective Math classes bring us money with the AP classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said Science has larger class sizes as students are allowed to double up and this affects the statistics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marti said pre-calculus is being offered throughout the district.  Doubling up is not allowed in Math classes for next year. This affects about 40 students. Marti said there are students that need a 4<sup>th</sup> year Math class.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said many of our kids are college bound and it is more challenging today to get into college.  Many students come here for what we have to offer to make a difference in special courses we offer.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if we could handle the number of students who need Health?  We offer it in 9<sup>th</sup> now, but some 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup>, next year 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> will need to take it.  The 12<sup>th</sup> graders will have to take it on cyber high.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked about clerical staffing.  He asked this of Katie.  She said that given Lauren’s remarks at the last meeting this was not considered.  Cutting an hour per clerical position would be a larger reduction than 6.5%.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if we could continue to look at this in a dollar amount and then decide how much to reduce clerical and IT support personnel.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked about discretionary funds and Marcus said they are still discretionary.  Patrick said at other schools these booster funds from parents are  put into supplies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said she is not comfortable with the Librarian being part of English. Marcus said literacy is one of our priorities.  Literacy should be taught through all the content areas.  The Librarian will work with all departments.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen asked if all the teachers from Newcomer have been placed. Marcus was not sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph felt that classroom teachers put in more hours than the counselors.  He said that teachers work on the weekends.  Counselors justified Bounmy for helping them with all the various tasks.  Perhaps the counselors should stay after school to do this work and come in on the weekends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren said counselors do not take a prep, they work on the weekends.  Lauren said she stays until 4, 4:30 or 5 and she takes work home for letters of recommendations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said the district’s idea about this budget is divisive for the school.  Why can’t we tell the district we won’t accept this and ask them to use their reserve? He said we would tell the district it is unreasonable to take a 7.5% cut when the district has a big pool of money.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he must turn in a budget by March 23rd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said that we need to have our strength of community.  He feels the rainy day fund will be released.  We should cut to the bone on supplies—0 like GWHS has done for the last several years.  The budget will come back to us.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said he supports what Bounmy does but we are fat on secretarial staff.  Lincoln has the same amount of clerical as we do.  Washington has the same amount of clerical as Galileo and they have more students.  Patrick would like to see the cuts across the board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethan said PE has 137 students who did not pass the Physical Fitness Exam and they must take PE all 4 years.  We are the only school in the district that gives PE credit for athletics—this is to make sure class sizes are lower.  Now the PE department will not sign off on this. He mentioned ROTC and now it is an elective class while PE is Core curriculum.  Only PE credits can be given for ROTC if the instructor has a PE credential.  He sees class sizes of 55 with only 4 PE teachers.</p>
<p>He also mentioned 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> grade curriculum for PE.  Will the 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> grade classes be combined?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said if his figures were right, we might have to add 2 more PE teachers to make sure all students are covered.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said we should leave it like it is and then we are OK in the fall.  Ethan is worried that teachers we want would be consolidated and would go elsewhere and not want to come back if more money comes our way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle wanted to know about electives in English.  She also asked if they could forgo the electives to reduce class sizes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen is worried about losing competent teachers and picking up teachers who do not speak English well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethan said the administration has done an outstanding job of hiring new teachers that are a good fit for the culture and climate of the school.  He mentioned the test scores, and he also mentioned the Superintendent’s Zone.  We have raised our API scores.  Why are we not being protected?  He felt we should be projected and this should be put to the Central Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Karin asked what would happen if we submit a budget that is not balanced.  We have never done it.  Marcus said we have to turning a balanced budget and we cannot protect anyone. We can have a priority list if we get more funds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise talked about a similar situation that happened last year, although not with as many cuts. We want to teach and to teach well.  Marcus said the administrators do advocate as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren said with AVID they take from the academic middle—2.5-3.3 students.  AVID ups the AP funds with their students.  AA, AI and Pacific Islander are higher percentage in AVID then the general population.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph wanted to know about the cuts—are these based on seniority?  He said VPA has a 1-year requirement.  PE has a 2-year requirement.  How can we meet the requirements with the same number of sections?</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said if we cut AVID, we should be looking for professional development for English teachers to include those methodologies in their English classes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next steps:  UBC meeting after school today, SSC meeting tomorrow.  Marcus is not sure what to do with the PE situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked for another version of the “Talking Points” with a change in PE by the end of the day.  The administration said,” Yes.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica suggested taking names off comments from the minutes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick suggested a header from Marcus at the top of the minutes saying these are challenging times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 12:15pm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 11:20am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.            Budget</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we would give everyone 4 minutes to provide their feedback.  Everyone will be on a timer.  Then we will send Bettie’s notes to the SSC so they can read this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked for the process.  The Leadership Team’s feedback will be given to the SSC.  Ethan asked if the Leadership Tem would make a presentation to the SSC.  Marcus said the SSC will get the information from these notes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if we were taking a vote on our information.  Marcus and Katie indicated they have the budget sheets and the feedback from this Leadership Team meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if the administration was endorsing this proposal.  The answer is no.  Marcus said they listed all the scenarios on the budget sheets.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if the Yearbook and Journalism classes would go to after school activities.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony said they cut everything except what students need to graduate—A-G requirements.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben asked if there are some items we could all agree on prior to each department’s thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8211;Time reduced to 3 minutes per department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A.  Math</p>
<p>&#8211;Re: counselors—since parents were not aware of this—we have managed without them, so let’s continue this way.  Re:  Journalism and Yearbook—let’s do after school.  Re:  ROTC—if we discontinued this program, could we put them into PE.  Marti said she doesn’t know enough about the politics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B.  Lauren</p>
<p>&#8211;Para—to take away a para would be detrimental to the Counseling Office.; His duties include:  textbook collection/data; testing prep for AP, STAR, EAP, CELDT, CAHSEE (5XS), and all make-up tests.  He does all the cum folders, speaks 3 languages (Cantonese, Lao, Thai), answers the phone, fixes the copy machines does photocopying, helps with registration for incoming families and reclassifications for ELD.  Testing cannot continue in the counseling office if he is cut.  He is willing to take on more duties.</p>
<p>&#8211;Counseling cannot make a decision on cutting a para for a college counselor.</p>
<p>&#8211;AVID—why is this  program being cut when it is the only program to support students meet the A-G requirements.</p>
<p>&#8211;95% of AVID seniors graduate A-G and go to a 4-year college.  50% of senior class goes to a 4-year college .</p>
<p>&#8211;AVID 9 does not cost the school additional funds, as they would be taking Health Ed and College and Career. Now they do it on cyber high.  She can cut AVID 10 to one section.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren’s Case loads would be redesigned if AVID is cut.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C.  World Languages</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said they would like to have a teacher for teaching in the classroom rather than an extra counselor.  They are concerned about testing native speakers.  They are concerned about students testing out.  They do not want to lose teachers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>D.  VPA</p>
<p>&#8211;Wants the para position kept on rather than another counselor.</p>
<p>&#8211;He wants to support Ethan and PE and have the military stop dominating the situation.  He feels it is a wash whether we keep an ROTC teacher or a PE teacher.  He feels a fully credentialed PE teacher will be better than a special credential for the ROTC teacher.</p>
<p>&#8211;In the budget scenarios he does not like all the notes that say “No Change.”  He feels it should be all across the board.  Marcus said that Janet Schulze said that there will be no cuts in administrators.  Joseph felt that everyone should be cut equally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E.  PE</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan has always supported to ROTC program.  But, with 2 FTE cuts in PE it does not seem right. PE is a core curriculum course and 2 years are required for graduation.  ROTC is now an elective and PE credits are given in an Independent Study Program.  Sports team players also get Independent Study in PE for playing sports.</p>
<p>&#8211;His department said that class size would be increased if the Independent Study program was dropped.</p>
<p>&#8211;In 2014 a PE credential will be required for ROTC instructors.  We would be saving a temporary position for just 1 year if we keep ROTC.</p>
<p>&#8211;Students who do not pass 5 out of 6 content standards must take another year of PE.  This could affect 100-300 students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>F.  Library/UBC</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if the Asst. Superintendent has signed off on any cuts in administrative positions in our school as well as other schools.</p>
<p>&#8211;Given across the board 6.5% board cuts—where are they reflected ion non-classified and non –certificated at Galileo in secretaries and tech support?</p>
<p>&#8211;Can we look at the allocations and ratios for non-classroom staffing at other schools?</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said we were strongly encouraged to cut clerical.  We are fat compared to other schools.</p>
<p>&#8211;Are there any other monies in the school that can be applied to non=personnel?</p>
<p>&#8211;Does the administrative team consider credentialing, i.e. people’s jobs when making cuts?</p>
<p>&#8211;The superintendent said the cuts would be even across the board—he would like to see this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if there were paras doing work outside their content area.  The answer was Bounmy.  Most paras have classroom duties.  This could be a possible problem situation.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if the administration looked at credentials of all staff to see what switches could be made.  The answer was no.</p>
<p>&#8211;If the Library position goes to .4, the library would be open one period a day with one warehouse prep; probably not open at lunch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>G.            Karin</p>
<p>&#8211;Cuts should be all across the board.  This is not the right time to add a counselor.</p>
<p>&#8211;Karin said her position was being cut .6 and right now she does a full job.  She also does language support and will not be able to do that from the classroom.  We have over 1000Chinese speaking parents.</p>
<p>&#8211;She is for reducing the non-classroom expenses.  She thinks we can replenish supply money in the fall if we get more funds.  She does not want to loose good people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>H.  Social Sciences</p>
<p>— Mat said it is asking too much for reducing department budgets for a 1.0 FTE, not knowing where that position would be.  Not a good idea to deplete the department budget to 0 and preserve 1 FTE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.            ELD</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen discussed the Newcomer Pathway and that we have been working on a very good program. The stakes have changed.  We have had changes of personnel.  Students only get credit for 1 year in English for an ELD class at level 5 or above.  Students are coming in at a lower level now.  60% of those ELL who made the A-G came through our program.</p>
<p>&#8211;Cutting Drama is a big blow to the department.  It is difficult.  Our teachers are trained now to work on writing and speaking and it is different than other schools.</p>
<p>&#8211;About 500 fewer language students who are tested out will not need World Language.</p>
<p>&#8211;Dropping the Arts classes is also a big blow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>J.            English</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said with cuts, any additions do not make sense.  Adding a counselor is not good.</p>
<p>&#8211;Cuts should be equitable and there should be a cut across the board including administrators.</p>
<p>&#8211;Eliminating electives is a topic.  Her department does not have the luxury of offering electives.   24% of students are not college ready in English according to the EAP.  We need to have more support classes in English for our school.  The proposal cuts 5sections from English.  Other departments do not have cuts.  Yesterday she pointed out that English is the only subject that requires 4 years.</p>
<p>&#8211;She would propose eliminating AVID and have those teachers teach English.</p>
<p>&#8211;Cuts in the library would also be cuts in computer lab time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>K.            Ben</p>
<p>&#8211;With computer science bumped up to 4 classes, you must consider that a teacher can only have 3preps.  We might build a program that we can’t support with teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;There is a period that is set-aside for Information Technology—we do need to have this support to keep our wireless system up and running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>L.  Science</p>
<p>&#8211;David said Science supports not adding a counselor.  Not appropriate. The classroom is already receiving a big hit.</p>
<p>&#8211;Yearbook and Journalism should be after school programs.</p>
<p>&#8211;Priority should be to maintain our teaching staff.  If we lose current staff, we lose all our training and that is a huge hit.  We do not want to have the giant turn over like other schools have.</p>
<p>&#8211;ROTC—he has a hard time supporting this program.  Lots of students love it.  Money is a wash.  Our PE teachers do a lot for the school besides teaching classes—like sponsoring clubs, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Supplies—we do need a minimum amount. We should run on bare bones next year.  Maybe parents and teachers can add in a little more.  Saving a position should be a big priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if there were any discretionary funds.  Marcus will think about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consensus Items</p>
<p>&#8211;We should not add an additional counselor.  Marcus asked if this was true for everyone and it is.</p>
<p>&#8211;Move Yearbook and Journalism to an after school program—Marcus said it will be difficult to recruit students.  Michelle said students will want to do this if they want to have a yearbook.</p>
<p>&#8211;With Futurama, if 8 students want to do an activity they will fund it.  Joseph said there is a core of students who want to do the program.</p>
<p>&#8211;The principal supports keeping ROTC.  The rest of the group did not.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said that the cuts should be equitable across the board—6.5%, except for what the district does.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we do need to keep program need in mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said we should address paras, IT tech and secretaries, and if we make cuts there how much of FTE can we fund?</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen talked about the lower salaries of the paras and all the slack they pick up at a lower cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus asked if everyone felt we should cut Classified 6.5 across the board.  The group said No.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben asked if we should cut a secretary.  David said there should be some way to make the cuts equitable.</p>
<p>&#8211;If we approve for Bounmy to stay where he is? Patrick said the contract might be an issue.  Patrick will see if there will be a grievance filed.  He also mentioned grievances in the future such as Health Ed credit for cyber high, and PE credit through Independent Study.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti said absolutely teachers are #1 and running a school involves the cost of doing business.  She said if there is a secretary eliminated, we must think about who is leaving and what skills they have.  Without these supports in place there are problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it a district wide policy there will be no administrative cuts?</p>
<p>Can monies in the school that are in slush funds or discretionary funds in the school to be used for such things as science equipment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;If we leave operating costs at the 2%, we can have 1.0 FTE saved.  Everyone agreed.  Journalism and Yearbook are a .4.  Katie will confirm with Futurama about funding those two activities.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan suggested the administration revise their proposal and bring it back to the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will meet again on Tuesday, March 13<sup>th</sup> at 4<sup>th</sup> period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 12:20pm.</p>

<p align="right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>3/8/12</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 11:20am.  Marcus proposed that we postpone the agenda items and just talk about Budget.  Everyone agreed.  We will have a meeting next week to address the rest of the issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Budget</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie distributed information from past years’ budgets.  We will have a deficit next year of over $650,000.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said the district says we must use 2% for operating expenses.  We have always spent more than 2%.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie distributed a set of possible changes.  The SSC will review this and the principal will make the final decisions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked if there had been discussions with the district as the district has a $55 million reserve.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said we have to submit a budget by March 23 with the allocation the district has given us.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked if there has been discussion with the district about their tremendous reserve.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we need to finish this discussion and then Marcus will go to the district.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie reviewed the document District and School Site Possible Changes document. These are all proposals—room for additions and changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie reviewed what the district will pay for next year and some of the changes we would make.  The cost column shows where the savings would be.</p>
<p>&#8211;Proposal now is to add a counselor, pay for the nurse and grant a stipend as opposed to a prep.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie explained the Non-Classroom and Classroom changes.  The document showed the average class size and any changes that would occur.  She reviewed the courses and indicated where the cuts would be in sections.</p>
<p>&#8211;Top part of the document represents savings of over $70,000 and the bottom portion shows savings of over $581,000.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked about Biotech—Katie said it is listed in Science.  Marcus said he and Stan would meet about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick suggested meeting about this again tomorrow during 4°.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben asked the group if this seems like something that has happened before.  Discussion followed about past years and that last year the fact that Scenario B was bad.  The year before that, Joseph indicated that VPA lost 2 positions.  For next year VPA is losing 15% while the rest of the school is losing 7%.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said that when cuts happen it is often necessary to go to the minimums.  The VPA graduation requirement is 1 course for one year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Graduation requirements are now aligned to the A – G requirements—language, math and science requirements have gone up.  Katie pointed out that the district graduation requirements have changed—not the state’s requirements, but the district’s.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if we have pushed back to the district about the effects.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus brought up the remedial courses and how they do not count for graduation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen asked about ROTC.  Marcus gave the history of this area and talked about the fact that we were on probation for the program as we only had one instructor.  Stan mentioned that ROTC pays for one position if we have it.  The Army is now requiring the ROTC teachers to have a PE credential which will take place in several years.</p>
<p>&#8211;Those students who double up in AP classes bring the school more money.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle brought up the issue of larger class sizes.  She is concerned that the advanced classes are the smaller ones and the under served students are in the larger classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about class sizes with AP and Academy classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said that the English classes for AoHT have 39 students.  AoIT has lots of requests to be in this program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick wanted to discuss the Non-Personnel area.  Katie explained that the 2% would cover school-wide supplies, but departments would get nothing to very little.  David said that would impact all of the life science classes with labs.  English would not be able to order novels.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked Joseph about his budget.  Prop H was discussed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben said he felt the question is will all departments be willing to give up supplies to cover a 1.0 FTE, and if so, what department would have that 1.0 teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed about state adopted textbooks and who pays and what happens when books are lost.  David and Denise told of the textbook inventory checks by the district.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti discussed Math Department finances.  She said they need paper, ink and an Excel program.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle discussed the benefits of having 2 AVID teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked about the rationale of choosing ROTC over 1.0 FTE in PE.  Marcus said the program is popular, a political issue and financially is a wash over having more sections of PE.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked about class sizes in ROTC.  Nancy said we cannot require students to take ROTC.</p>
<p>&#8211;The Army requires 100 students enrolled to continue ROTC.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick mentioned the union contract and what comes up when teachers are reassigned.  Katie asked about the money.  Patrick said we should look into all of this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick congratulated everyone who has worked on this budget.  Katie mentioned that she was sad over this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about with the reduction of students, why are we adding a counselor and cutting teachers?</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said this is a result of continued parent complaints about their students not being able to be seen by a counselor.  This is coming from the students and the parents.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said our current enrollment is 2070.</p>
<p>&#8211;PTSA and Community Meetings were the source of the parent and student complaints about not being able to see counselors.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned some department chairs would resign if the district removed the department head period and offered a stipend; many department chairs might resign.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben said we should rerun this with no AP preps and no Department Head periods.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said with the superintendent’s zone, we could lose 10 teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said many schools run Yearbook and Journalism as after school activities.</p>
<p>&#8211;Journalism is in English; Yearbook is an elective that meets a G requirement.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said Yearbook/Journalism, PE/ROTC, Counselor and supplies are important issues.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie explained the financial issue of funding for the nurse.</p>
<p>&#8211;The Librarian funding would decrease next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray felt Peer Resource is an important program here for Special Ed.  Jessica said the PRC classes are small, so maybe combining them into 2 sections would be financially good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus asked everyone to digest this information and make plans for arguments to the SSC.  We will meet again tomorrow during 4<sup>th</sup> period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 12:15pm.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team/Department Heads Meeting</span></strong></p>
<p align="right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>2/23/12</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Academic Honesty</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus emailed his colleagues and received information from Lincoln and Balboa that he shared with the group.  He asked members to take the information back to their departments for feedback.  He suggested we table this item until the next meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Master Schedule Update</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said we are done registering students on the Google form. She is waiting for the district to be ready for the district registration.  She hopes to be able to have counselors start this process in the next several days.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy will need to get information from this group about placements and she will send out a Google dock for this issue.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle brought up the fact that some teachers feel with some students it is not a good idea for them to register for honors or AP classes.  She asked about the process.  Nancy reviewed the problems we had with this last fall.</p>
<p>&#8211;If a teacher does not give approval for an AP or honors class, the counseling office will honor the teacher’s request.  There is a criteria for honors and AP classes and if the students do not meet the criteria, then they should not take those classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said his department has so many students signing up, that they have to cut students, so they drop the students who do not qualify.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti discussed how the Math department did this last year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus mentioned the superintendent’s policy, but if we have criteria, we can honor that.  We also look at each student on an individual basis.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy will send out information next week.  She would like to have information by March 16<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked which weeks of the first 6-weeks a student could opt out of honors or AP classes.  Nancy said that they need to go through the 7-step process.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said there would not be placement tests for incoming 9<sup>th</sup> graders in May, as the district changes the information over the summer.  This year we will do the placement tests the first few days of school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked about the Feb. 6<sup>th</sup> access to Scheduler.  This always causes a “crunch.”  Nancy said she has to enter the information on Scheduler and it is easier to provide this information to the faculty after it has been entered.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben asked when the new system, Genesis, will be ready.  Nancy said we are supposed to be using it by this time next year.  Nancy said the district has not signed the contract yet.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said the name has been changed to Synergy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the budget is due on March 23<sup>rd</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said that low-level ELL students should not be taking foreign language.  Nancy said that it can be posted on the transcripts that these students have taken foreign language.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise asked when we will know how many students and how many sections?  She mentioned that we will need to order books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Budget Update</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said we would take a $659,000 hit next year.  This is reflecting a drop of 147 students.  We are being budgeted at what we are showing now.  2,074 students for next year.  Ethan asked if there is Scenarios A, B and C, and Katie said no.  She also mentioned that schools across the district are looking at the same drops.  We are getting more SCE and AP monies, down in all other categories.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we would be moving fast with the SSC to make decisions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie asked everyone to hoard supplies, as it will be thinner next year.  She asked everyone to conserve supplies so we can go with a lower operating budget.  The district is mandating that 2% of budgets have to go for operating budget. David would like to know how that compares with our budget this year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked if it would be SSC, Administration, and Leadership Team making the decisions on cuts.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said the district will issue many lay-off notices—it will be blanketed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we will work from our priorities, and then A-G requirements.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we would know by March 23<sup>rd</sup> if we will have layoffs.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said the two priorities are to keep staff and keep lower class sizes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said there are still some protected positions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said last year we spent $292,000—on operating budget—that is 3% of our total budget.  Next year we will have $177,513 for operating budget.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise asked about ordering books for next year and what the deadlines will be.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked if the seniors have to pay for their own graduation.  The seniors now have $17.000 and graduation costs around $13,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Hall Sweep Update</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison reported on the Hall Sweeps.  We have done 3 of them and we will continue to do this once a day for the next week and then on a random basis.  Everyone who is caught gets detention that day.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said this is fantastic.  He mentioned that the security aides have had hours and pay cuts. Please thank the security aides for their hard work with the hall sweeps.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise mentioned the U’s for citizenship grades for tardies, absences, electronics, etc.  She would like to see this enforced as a school policy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph would like to have the administration see the attendance issues the parents complain about from the teachers’ perspectives.</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison said hall passes now have become a hot commodity as students are grabbing them so they can be in the halls.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said we should gather some data—why are students out of class, how many hall passes have been stolen, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise suggested we always ask students why they are out of class in the halls.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen suggested a secret code on the back of the pass.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we will discuss this again in a few weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         NASA Visit Update</p>
<p>&#8211;We now have the name of the astronaut—Captain Daniel W. Bursch.</p>
<p>&#8211;Karen sent out 11 invitations to district personnel.  She has heard from 6 that they will be coming.</p>
<p>&#8211;Karin has 36 confirmed students and would like to have 9 more.  The students will mingle with the district personnel, the NASA visitors, can win prizes, and other benefits.</p>
<p>&#8211;Karin distributed information on the event.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said it would be great to include some of the under served students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the date for the Spring Open House.  Marcus said we would table this item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Professional Courtesy</p>
<p>&#8211;Mathew mentioned an email folks received from one of his department members.  This involved a staff member removing a student from the classroom without acknowledging the teacher, while the class was taking a test.</p>
<p>&#8211;We should greet each other as professionals.  This is great for morale.  Remind out department members to say Hi to other adults.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said it was easier to meet other teachers when faculty meetings were held in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben reminded everyone not to give students your passwords.  Do not let students enter grades, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus thanked Jessica, Wellness, and GSA for the LoveFest.  We also got good press from Ms. Franzen’s class at Crissy Field.  Also, thanks to Sgt. Hardee and Rebecca for the BSU assembly.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle felt that this assembly was invitational, but if it concerns cultural awareness, everyone should go.  It is hard to have mandatory assemblies, but we need to make sure students can go to assemblies concerning their cultures.</p>
<p>&#8211;Some suggested that some boring assemblies be eliminated.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned the two invitational assemblies he puts on.  He discussed the timing and felt that the last week of a grading period is not a good time for an assembly.</p>
<p>&#8211;On March 5<sup>th</sup>, SFPD will put on a presentation on different careers.  They will target students who are on the cusp of truancy.  Students will be given a pass to the presentation.  These are not chronically truant students.   This will address what students can do with just a high school diploma.</p>
<p>&#8211;Requests were made to have this presentation at other than class time.  Allison said she is not able to do the scheduling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leadership Team adjourned at 11:15pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Heads</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Policy for Students Returning Books</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said Allison Wagner is seeing a problem with Cyber High and the materials that are distributed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Some felt we have no policy for returning textbooks.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph felt the real deadline is when they graduate.  He felt that they should be penalized at the end of each school year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick suggested we table this until we get a clear handle on the program.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said her department hands out the cards, if the books are not returned then Connie goes after the students to return the books.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned the English department book room usually gets all returned books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         CPT-ELL</p>
<p>&#8211;This will be the topic for Wednesday’s meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus will distribute information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       School Loop/Department Meeting</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned an email Marcus distributed from a parent.  Much discussion in her department and between department heads followed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked what Marcus’ response to the parent was.  Marcus said he emailed the individual teachers of the students to email the parent.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle would like to see what the teachers thought about this and what kind of support they can expect.</p>
<p>&#8211;This will be tabled until the next meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;David felt this should be brought up at the next faculty meeting, and Marcus could provide his expectations.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti and Michelle thought mixing with other department members would produce helpful conversations about School Loop—strategies, practices, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise mentioned the startling of the short bell rings for the custodians.  Is there another way of alerting the custodians?</p>
<p>&#8211;David saw that the next staff meeting is March 14<sup>th</sup>, and he thought we might move it up to February 29<sup>th</sup>, as the following week is not an early release date.</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat asked for a quick decision on this as he has a guest speaker scheduled.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said he has databases to promote in each department.  Some teachers use these for research projects.  David said these have citable sources.  Patrick will come to department meetings and provide instructions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said there was no tardy report with the bell schedule options—passing time 5 minutes or 7 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked Marcus about Special Ed data.  She mentioned she has heard that some of the regular ed. teachers are not the best match for students coming out of special ed. Teachers are labeled “effective” or “not effective” with working with these students.  She felt some of the language should be changed when asking teachers if they will accept these students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested that no class should have more than the percentage of Special Ed students in the school.  He said this is an equity issue.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said it is an equity issue for students as well.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise suggested para support in the classroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:30am.</p>

<p align="right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>2/9/12</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.            Academic Honesty</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus received a report from Mr. Flisak on cheating.  Marcus asked the group for their input.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben said copying and cheating is the norm.  David Barrios said he gives a “0” on an assignment if he catches a student cheating.</p>
<p>&#8211;Delores  Lee said that kids take pictures of homework and post it on Facebook.  Test are also posted on Facebook.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben found students copying right in front of him with homework for another teacher.  He sends students to the Deans’ Office for suspension when he catches cheating.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy mentioned students attempting to cheat on the CAHSEE yesterday.  Even though the questions are in different order for different versions of the test, Tony said it is possible to match the graphics and copy answers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica wanted to know what message students get from Galileo about cheating—messages on walls about zero tolerance?</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen felt that we need to define cheating.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said her teachers cover in the beginning of the year what is and what is not cheating.  Different teachers have different policies, but they state them and the consequences in their syllabus.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph felt it is hard to start a new policy now, but the group disagreed.</p>
<p>&#8211;David talked about an incident last year where the student who was receiving the department award was caught cheating.  It was a difficult situation.  He felt that no student thinks cheating is OK, but that it is easy to get away with.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen told of a similar incident.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said cheating is not acceptable at any time of the year.  He spreads the students out and does as much as he can to make sure they do not cheat.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle felt teachers are changing the way they are assessing students, especially at the college level.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony mentioned, “When does collaborating become cheating?”</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben felt we have to deal with the issue of students wanting to get points for good grades.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus will call other principals to see what is happening at other schools and we will continue the discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph talked about artists and musicians modeling their work after their predecessors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.            Bell Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we are still working on the spreadsheet for the student survey.  We are looking at A and B and the difference is the amount of passing period minutes.  Tony is still working on the student schedules.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked if there are more students late with a 5-minute passing period, versus a 7-minute passing period. Concrete data will be good.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony talked about information on School Loop about tardies—biggest amount was for first period and then right after lunch.</p>
<p>&#8211;Suggestion was made to compare 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> period tardies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.            School Loop</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed a packet on School Loop.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he gets lots of interest from the parents about School Loop, particularly the 9th and 10<sup>th</sup> grade parents, as they are used to it from middle school.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus told of his experience at the training for School Loop.  The trainer has a student at Galileo and she was disappointed she only hears from one of her son’s teacher on School Loop.</p>
<p>&#8211;66% of our teachers completed the survey on School Loop.  Most of those felt comfortable using School Loop.  Tony went through questions on the survey and some of the results.</p>
<p>&#8211;Needing training and lack of time were the main reasons teachers were not using School Loop.  The training is from 4-6pm, after the working day.</p>
<p>&#8211;25% of parents are registered to use School Loop.  Ray mentioned that we have a minority using School Loop.  Tony said at his former school 90% of the parents were using it and all the teachers were.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben felt that we need to tell parents what is going on with their kids.  Patrick felt we have high school students.  The parent is not holding their hand all the time, but we do need to check on how the students are doing.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed about using School Loop, time it takes to post grades, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph told of his experiences and he said it is a good communication tool with the students who use it more often than the parents. Joseph felt the trainings should be done in the common planning time, not after school.  4-6pm is his time and there are other activities that he needs to do.  We are professionals and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>&#8211;The district is using our building for a district-wide School Loop training, and that is why it is scheduled from 4-6pm.</p>
<p>&#8211;David suggested we do in-house training.  Many teachers do not know how to do many of the items on School Loop.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan says School Loop takes time.  He would like the district to do a survey of what times during the day/evening/night the data is input.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we will use School Loop next year in some way.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said that School Loop is a contract issue.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said if we have School Loop access at school, the principal can put it in the Principal’s Expectations.</p>
<p>&#8211;David Barrios brought up the fact that those teachers not contacting parents by School Loop are contacting parents in other ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.            February 14<sup>th</sup> Wellness &amp; GSA Event</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica talked about this event.  This concerns sexual health and teen relationships.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica said she had 2 pregnant students in her office this morning.  This happens often.</p>
<p>&#8211;She talked about students in abusive relationships.</p>
<p>&#8211;She talked about students working on “coming out” to their parents.</p>
<p>&#8211;This event will be highlighted on the district website next week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Our ELL students do not know where to get reproductive information.</p>
<p>&#8211;There will be 42 workshops this year. She asked the members of this group to sign up.</p>
<p>&#8211;Some teachers are giving students extra credit for the noon-time activities.  Please encourage your teachers to participate.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said some of his students asked him to officiate at their wedding at the event.  Jessica told him to see Jackie Peters.  She told of the educational games by the marriage booths.</p>
<p>&#8211;Price to get married is 50 cents.  Proceeds go to GSA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.            Policy for Food Sales</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat asked what the school policy is. Marcus said there should not be any food sales on campus.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica said any candy sales for students are against district policy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Food Sales to teachers are OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.            Rise in Hall Walking</p>
<p>&#8211;We are being vigilant to curb this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII.            CAHSEE</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said the auditorium was chaos and not well thought out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Head</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus gave kudos to Ray for his efforts to give Special Ed. students the regular tests.</p>
<p>&#8211;CST—California Standards Test—what everyone takes.  CMA is a modified assessment.  It is almost as difficult as the CST.  CMA does not count towards the school’s API.</p>
<p>&#8211;CAPA is for the severely impaired students.</p>
<p>&#8211;State goal is to have no more than 3% of students taking the CMA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.            Testing Update</p>
<p>&#8211;City College Placement Exam is February 24<sup>th</sup> for seniors going to City College.  It will be at Galileo from approximately 8am-noon.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said last year CCSF gave the SFUSD priority for 2 classes they had to take.  This year our students attending CCSF have to have at least 3 classes that will transfer to a 4 year university.</p>
<p>&#8211;The test will be given in the library.  Students sign up for the test.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray would like his students to take the test at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8211;CAHSEE—this past one was our census test and counts for the API score.  On both dates we tested 98% of the students we were supposed to test.  We needed to test at least 95%.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said it was a little bit chaotic for those students who did not have a place to go when their classrooms were being used.  This is a whole school effort.  She asked for cooperation from all staff and teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise mentioned miscommunication on the second day.  The time of 10:30am was confusing and some students did not finish by that time.  Denise asked about students who did not report to her class until after 11am.  Discussion followed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested we plan a fun activity for those students who finish the test by 10:30am.  Kathleen said that some kids might rush through the test to go out and play.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the auditorium and how it was used.  Joseph turned the house lights up, as he felt it was too dark inside.</p>
<p>&#8211;Those two specific days are the only days we can do the CAHSEE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;9<sup>th</sup> Grade Practice CAHSEE</p>
<p>&#8211;This year we can decide if we want to give it.  Ray and Kathleen both said, “No.”</p>
<p>&#8211;Will having the test improve our passing rate?  Ray said there are no stakes.  Decision made not to give it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.            Registration</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said they should finish on time by Feb. 17<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;We can enter the information in Scheduler right after that, by the beginning of March.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.            Academic Literacy Discussion Check-in</p>
<p>&#8211;Academic Literacy is a school priority.  First we have to define academic literacy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat said his department included reading, writing, academic norms—bring materials to class, ask for help, etc.  Know how to act in academic environment.</p>
<p>&#8211;Science focused on the standards. Specifics come from the standards.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said her department came up with definitions—and ability to navigate all of their classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said her department mostly talked about AP classes and what is expected of these students.  High literacy is one of the issues.  They do SSR in the target language.</p>
<p>Students who are ELD in their classes do very well.  They learn from the ground up.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned his department came up with 40 words that would apply to all his classes and were what the students should know by graduation.  He also liked the academic norms—bring a pencil.</p>
<p>&#8211;Standard Literacy in an Academic School, then Department literacy—Tony mentioned this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Academic Literacy means different things to different people.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said in their department said they talked about navigating through a textbook, etc. He mentioned the parts of a textbook.  These things need to be taught.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony will put all this information together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.            Common Formative Assessments &amp; Data Director</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus gave some background information on the usefulness of this information.</p>
<p>&#8211;The goal is for every course to have a common assessment and have a common final exam.</p>
<p>&#8211;This goal is for next fall.</p>
<p>&#8211;One a piece of data is entered for a student, it is linked to the content standards and teachers can watch their students over time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Any assessment teachers are now doing can be digitized.  This requires using rubrics.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said the big task is to get together with the teachers to work this out.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony said it will take time to get this all set up.  What am I teaching, how am I teaching, and do I have a good collaborative relationship with other teachers who are teaching the same course?</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed.</p>
<p>&#8211;David mentioned that much has been going on this year with data, etc., and there has not been much time to talk about curriculum.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise is not sure how to explain this to her colleagues.  She asked for Tony to come and help her.  She also mentioned Chinese literacy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle talked about Common Planning Time.  In the past one hour was Cluster Meetings, and one hour was Department Time.  She said this year they do not have the time to do this.  Marcus said those discussions will happen once we get the CLA and Data Director in place.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus told about his experience at Thurgood Marshall.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony said he is hearing that teachers want to have more planning time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said we need more staff development.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said everyone in the district supports CLA, but Data Director is not mandatory now.  We need to develop the CLAs first and then get to Data Director.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11;50AM.</p>
