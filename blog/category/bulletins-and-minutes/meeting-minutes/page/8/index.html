<p align="center"><strong>12/13/12</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          AP Course Enrollment/New Contract</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked how we would handle the concept of open enrollment into the AP classes, given the new contract.  If the course has 25 students, the teacher is given an AP prep.  What happens if a student drops a class—does the teacher lose the AP prep?</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said she has no plans to change the 7-step process for a student to drop a class.  Nancy would not change the Master Schedule if a student drops the class.  Marcus said the AP preps will stay as they are in place at the beginning of the school year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked if the district would do an audit during the year.</p>
<p>&#8211;As of right now, with 25 students in an AP class, the teacher will get an AP prep.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said that they would talk to the district if an audit proceeds.</p>
<p>&#8211;At the semester, students could leave an AP class only if they are failing or getting a D.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said his department is always over enrolled and mentioned evaluating those students who want to enroll in an AP class.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said that each department probably does this differently.  David feels this is up to the AP teacher.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug says he fits in as many students as he can that will fit in the room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked about how the counselors handle students signing up for multiple AP classes.  Lauren said they talk to the students, the parents, and they counsel them.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said last year if students had 3 or more AP or honors classes, they meet with the student to make sure the students know what they are getting into.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren suggested teachers give the counselors an idea of how many hours of homework each level has would help when the counselors talk to the students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked if we should get parental signatures for more than 3 of these classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said this year there are not as many students who are overwhelmed.  She mentioned 5 cases.</p>
<p>&#8211;David also mentioned students who do not do well in the AP classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said she needs feedback on Google registration sheets she sent to everyone by the end of finals week.</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked about course descriptions.  Nancy said it was online.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray asked about .71 Chemistry and when it will be on the item deck.</p>
<p>&#8211;Leah wanted to look at the AP Native Spanish speaker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said that freshmen will now have a choice of a VPA course or a World Language class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Winter Assembly Details</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked for clarification on 1 assembly or 2.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we plan for 2 but it will probably be 1.</p>
<p>&#8211;We will call the first group down and see how it goes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Traffic Sign for Bay Street</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen wants to keep it on the agenda until it happens.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said Katie has been making phone calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Finals Week Suggestions</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat asked if Homeroom would be Nutrition time.  Answer is Yes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Question was asked about the computer labs and homeroom.  There will be signs posted next week and the labs will only be for study.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Dress Code</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie talked about a student at the football banquet who was inappropriately dressed.  She looked in the Student Handbook and found a dress code.  She also added something from Balboa’s dress code.  Students will be sent home if they are dressed inappropriately.</p>
<p>&#8211;Please review these policies with your department.  Students can wear their PE uniforms or get clothes in the Deans’ Office.</p>
<p>&#8211;This is district policy and in the handbook.  We need to be consistent about this now and remind students.</p>
<p>&#8211;This is not something to suspend students for.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren asked if students could make up work for the time they are off campus to change.</p>
<p>&#8211;Call the Deans’ Office if you are unsure about dress or behavior.  If teachers feel uncomfortable addressing students, call the Deans.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug mentioned the past and students not wearing hats.  If there is not consistency, it will break down.  Katie said this is also a safety issue.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug would like to take this out of the teacher’s responsibility and give it to the Deans, counselors or administrators.</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison spoke about classroom rules and what the teacher’s rules are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Mandatory Lesson</p>
<p>&#8211;January 18<sup>th</sup> on Internet Safety.  Everybody has to do this.  This is funding for the state.  It will be during a specific period.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked if the video is culturally sensitive.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus will distribute copies of the directions.</p>
<p>&#8211;The state will capture the attendance for that date and period.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested we air it on G-House TV.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the TV networks not working with the change over.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said they switched from analog to digital and now each TV must have a box.  They will provide 3 boxes.  Each new box is $1.99 per month.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie will deal with Comcast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Heads </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          CLA</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed district information to apply for up to $2,000 in extended hours to work on CLAs.  Principals have been asking for compensation.  Let Lisa or Marcus know if you are interested.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus would like to see work on the CFAs and CLAs that we have been doing in English and Math.</p>
<p>&#8211;This is a project outside of the classroom.</p>
<p>&#8211;We will table this item until the next meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         CPT Calendar Spring 2013</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa thanked everyone for working with her and meeting with her.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa distributed the CPT calendar and did some highlighting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Yellow times are those each member should do the planning.  Lisa offered some suggestions.</p>
<p>&#8211;In January please let her know what you will be doing on those days—goals, activities, location, etc.  There is a share folder on Google Docs you can use.  She would like them to be all in that folder.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said this folder is a living document and members can make changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa mentioned the new grade level team meetings and how they would work.  This will be on January 10<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Balanced Score Card Data</p>
<p>&#8211;On January 16<sup>th</sup> there will be Balanced Score Card work in departments.  How do we pull out what is useful and how do we find out what is meaningful will be the topic on January 9<sup>th</sup>.  Then on the 16<sup>th</sup>, each department will be able to look at department data.  Lisa asked what each member would need to lead this meeting.</p>
<p>She mentioned needs, growths, etc.  Let Lisa know what data you want.</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked for a list of guiding questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Common Core</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said the Common Core is coming and will affect English and Math in a very extreme way, but it affects everyone across the board.</p>
<p>&#8211;The district has come up with some smart test questions they will provide.</p>
<p>&#8211;The Common Core Standards will be in effect in a year and a half—the implementation will occur at that time.</p>
<p>&#8211;She distributed one from Algebra and one from English for the group to look at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said in her department they learned that the standards have changed.  She said they looked at student work, what they are teaching, and what the standards are.  She said it was eye opening.  There are more demands from the students.  This is an elevation from what we have done in the past.  Much will depend on what the middle schools do with this and then what we do as the students enter high school.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph heard a report on MPR radio from Chicago, and it mentioned the test scores went down.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         ELL Next Steps</p>
<p>&#8211;Bissa is here for the meeting.  She spoke of the QTEL activities.  We received the Newcomer students when that school closed and we have the Lau walk through from last year.  She explained some of her activities.</p>
<p>&#8211;She asked for feedback on ways to move forward around ESL strategies.  She asked about ideas for professional development and what would be helpful.  When the IOC or Federal Government comes again, what would be helpful to move ahead?</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said the negative feedback from the past came from too much material for the time period.  It is hard to find time in CPT to do multiple presentations.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said that all the PD’s do not incorporate a math classroom.  This is frustrating for the Math teachers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Bissa is looking for ways to make things better.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said there is no discussion about language acquisition.  We have many students come with lower levels.  No discussion on how we learn language.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said folks were upset about the critique, but our scores are getting better.</p>
<p>&#8211;Leah said the model lessons they were given are geared toward the students, and not necessarily the teachers. Adult learners are not being engaged.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said that we need to start focusing on subject area groups, rather than the general sessions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned 2 years ago that we eliminated 9<sup>th</sup> grade honors.  This was supposed to be district wide.  She said there are still some 9<sup>th</sup> grade honors classes.  She asked if it is a possibility to reinstate 9<sup>th</sup> grade honors.  Nancy will look into this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug asked Nancy when she needs to know if some students cannot move on to the next Math level. She needs this information ASAP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David mentioned the Science Department budget and asked for extra funds.  He has some items that need replacing.  He also cannot send anyone to conferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;The PTSA and GAA are asking for grant applications.  Marcus said they are not getting enough applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:45am.</p>

<p align="right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>11/29/12</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus told everyone that Nancy had a death in the family and will be away until Monday.  She will get the registration sheets out to the department heads next Monday.  They will be due prior to Winter Break.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Field and AoHT would like to have a festival in the courtyard on December 14<sup>th</sup> to raise money.  They will be selling items and having food delivered.  Ethan asked about back up in case of rain.  Marcus suggested the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor hallway.  There will be 7-10 tables.  This is a project for the students.  They will come up with the products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Final Exam Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed a new final exam schedule.  He explained that we were called on the carpet by the district for not having enough instructional minutes.  We will have a homeroom for 40 minutes—we will call this a “Nutritional Homeroom.”  The final exams will be 2 hours and 15 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray asked about the Special Ed busses on 3 days.  We will have them but we have to pay for them.</p>
<p>&#8211;We will talk about next year’s bell schedule at the next meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Class Observations</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked for Lisa if the teachers would be willing to have Lisa and Bissa come and observe the classes. Joseph, Doug, Kathleen, Stan, Ethan, Michelle, Mat, Leah said Yes.  Ray said No.  Mat asked if they would be notified in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Substance Abuse Assembly Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica distributed a proposed schedule for that day, March 21, 2013.</p>
<p>&#8211;The left column shows a normal Thursday schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;This schedule would eliminate Homeroom and there would be 15 minutes less in the class times.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica explained the logistics of the assembly, the discussion after the assembly and there will be time for the regular class, which will be 15 minutes shorter than the normal block period.</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison said there has been an increase in marijuana use this year so this assembly will be very beneficial.</p>
<p>&#8211;The schedule was approved by the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Academic Integrity</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison asked if there is a school wide policy concerning cheating.  She said she and Mr. Emmi are noticing periods of time during the year when cheating is prevalent.</p>
<p>&#8211;They ask the teacher for their policy and if the students know it.  They talk to the student and then have the student write a letter of apology, and a paragraph about academic integrity. Then they set up a conference with the parent, the student, the teacher, the counselor and the Dean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David said we had discussed the need for a bare minimum of what will happen if a student cheats.  All students need to know this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison asked if we need more than this and David said we definitely do need more.  He would like a teacher component added—like the student should fail that assignment.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked if the school wide policy is in addition to each teacher’s individual policy.  The levels of plagiarism in the school vary.</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison felt the Deans’ Office would put out a policy, including a 0 on an assignment where the student cheated.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said that some students may not be clear on all forms of academic dishonesty.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug also said that cheating does not necessarily happen in front of the teacher the work is for, but in front of another teacher.  Katie indicted a school wide policy would cover this.  Joseph mentioned a part of Balboa’s policy—someone who gives someone else homework to copy is just as guilty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked for the insertion of sources students use for their outside papers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen felt that there should be some education to the students about cheating.  She mentioned that students cheat on the CAHSEE exam.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said her department is having more in class writing exams due to the Internet.  They also get an initial sampling of student writing at the beginning of the year to have a benchmark for each student.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about repeat offenses.  David said that Lincoln does a really nice job in this area.  Allison said they have not had a lot of repeat offenders.  She said that the students break down and cry within 7 minutes, and they have not had repeat offenders who were caught in the last year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David suggested using Lincoln’s policy.  He would like to go through it and see if there were some things he did not agree with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren mentioned situations that are dealt with by the teacher and don’t have to go to the Dean’s Office.  Teachers should keep track of the offenses.  Katie suggested putting this information into the online referral system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison said they have only received 1 written referral this year—all the rest have been online.  David said that once teachers write a referral they can access referrals from other teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison would like to see “Deans’ Office Referral Written and Entered into Permanent Record.”  This will be of value to those students who are anxious to go to college.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie would like to have the group take this to their departments and then review with the students, particularly with finals coming up.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen suggested using SSR time to address academic honesty, perhaps with a power point presentation.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle discussed doing this as teachers give reviews for their finals.</p>
<p>&#8211;David suggested having students sign an agreement.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked how we could get this back from the students who have to get their parent’s signature</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren suggested students sign in class and return that to the teacher.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie felt that the signature does not mean much for the kids.  She felt that if the form was distributed in Homeroom, on G-House TV, and discussed in every class that would be enough.</p>
<p>&#8211;David felt that the parents need to know this information.  Katie said this is in the handbook, and that the school can suspend.</p>
<p>&#8211;It can also be published on School Loop.</p>
<p>&#8211;Let Allison know by tomorrow if you have suggestions, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug asked about transitional students and how we handle them. Discussion followed concerning the advantages and disadvantages of identifying these students to all teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said that Wellness and Counseling work with the EWI students.  EWI—Early Warning Indicator—based on attendance and GPA.  This comes from Data Director.  Transitional Student information is more comprehensive.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica said the EWI list should be shared with students.  She also suggested sending both list and saying the students on the list are either EWI or transitional, but not identify who is on what list.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said he would like to know if students he refers are placed on the lists.  Katie said Donald shares his caseload with the staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.  Update on Slow School Zone Signs</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie called 311 twice and now she put Kelli Mallen on it.  Kelli is going to the Supervisor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked about CPT. Marcus said it is on the UBC agenda today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:05am.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Final Exam Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed a proposed schedule.  He mentioned that we never came to a final decision.  The group reviewed the document.</p>
<p>&#8211;Thursday and Friday will be half days.  It will be 8am – 1pm including lunch.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said that the deans want Thursday and Friday to be totally structured for students.  Marcus said the official line is “Students must be here.”</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa asked how the make-up exams work.  David said the students go where they need to go to make up their exams.</p>
<p>&#8211;One problem is students who just show up and walk the halls.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan suggested a video in the auditorium for those with no classes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Winter Assembly Schedule/Date</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus met with ASB last week and they would like to have the assembly on Dec. 14<sup>th</sup>.  They feel there will be better participation than on Dec. 21st.</p>
<p>&#8211;Leah talked about the practice AP tests and the time they take.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said we are only talking about 10 minutes of instructional time if the assembly is on Dec. 14<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;David and Leah mentioned the distractions of the assembly.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said that those students who are in the assembly put a lot of effort into the show.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said it seems too last minute at this time to move the assembly to December 7<sup>th</sup>.  She also felt moving it at all seems last minute.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus called for a vote on the 7<sup>th</sup>, 14, or 21<sup>st</sup>.  2 voted for the 7<sup>th</sup>, 2 voted for the 14<sup>th</sup>.   The assembly will be on December 21<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed on the schedule for December 21<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said Option 2 would allow some class work during 4<sup>th</sup> period.</p>
<p>&#8211;Option 2 will be the schedule for 12/21.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       BSC Review</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed copies of the Balanced Score Card.  He explained the process of developing it and distributed updated copies of the document.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa discussed updated data information.  She hoped for individual meetings on this document, for Section 2, Fall Data Review, pages 4-7. Marcus apologized for printing an out dated copy.  He will provide the current copy to everyone in  their mailboxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8212;Doug mentioned an article he read in a local newspaper that discussed a technique of testing/not testing Special Ed. students.  We are above board and test our Special Ed. students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Ordering School Wide Supplies</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug asked about school-wide supplies, like Kleenex.  He wanted to know if these had to be ordered by departments.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said departments did not have budgets at the beginning of the year.  Do we need to now allocate Kleenex from district budgets?</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug also asked about scantrons.  Are these school wide supplies?  Ink comes into the same category. CLA activity also used scantrons.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said we will always have paper, water and Xerox machines that work.  We have some Kleenex.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug felt that Kleenex falls under general and the school should pay for this.  Katie will add Kleenex to the list.</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked where to buy scantrons.  Respondents said check the Warehouse Catalogue.</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked about bulbs for LCD projectors.  Katie said we have 200 or so now.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ink for printers will be covered by Thong Ly.  Katie will check with him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Paper and Water Usage</p>
<p>&#8211;People are hoarding paper and water.  Katie asked for feedback to deal with this and curb the hoarding—to inspire responsible use.</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked if there is a way to find out how much usage there are on the machines and if this corresponds with the amount of paper usage.</p>
<p>&#8211;Either way we need to show more responsible use of paper.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie would like to promote responsible use of paper and copy machines.</p>
<p>&#8211;David suggested a copy machine in-service at the start of next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen suggested responsible students doing the copying.  Talk continued with the thought of having a para do the copying.  Teachers would have to turn in copy requests 24 hours ahead of time.</p>
<p>&#8211;We are 1/3 of the way through the school year and we have used ½ of our paper supply.</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked if we have more teachers this year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said she knows that many students are printing out their homework here on campus.  She asked where that paper comes from.</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked if we could limit student printing.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie asked everyone to have a conversation with their department about responsible use of paper.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we will look at the notes and return to the next meeting with some hard data.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested monitoring 307 and machines and paper for one day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Youth Vote/ Student Surveys</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie reminded everyone to turn them in.  Return them to the boxes in her outer office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII.      Slow School Traffic Signs</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen talked of hearing all the accidents on Bay Street.  She talked of Denise LeBiavant requesting this for many years.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said we have called in past years and nothing has been done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VIII.     School Site Council Membership</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said we have used the SFUSD make-up for membership.  This was 4 classroom teachers and one non-classroom personnel.  He checked the union guidelines and he explained those as more extensive.  All groups must be represented and the UBC rep is one of the teacher members.</p>
<p>&#8211;He also checked the State guidelines and they are the same as the union, but do not require the UBC rep to be one of the classroom teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;His proposal is to have 2 teachers, 2 community members, 2 parents, 2 students, 1 para, 1 SEIU worker, 1 non-classroom teacher, 2 classroom teachers including 1 UBC rep. Community members cannot be employed by the district.  Parent members should not be working at the school site.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan wants to put this in front of the SSC, but they do not meet until December and he would like to get this going before then.  He put this before the UBC and they said they would abide by what the Leadership Team votes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Each representative group would only vote for their representative.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the Leadership Team is not a decision making group.  We can make a recommendation.  The SSC can vote via email.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug asked where we get the community members.  Lisa said we put feelers out and then get resumes, and then make decisions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Membership is for 2 years. It as suggested that perhaps community members do not serve consecutive terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan talked about the problem of para representatives as they leave earlier than the end of the school day.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the possibility of a 3<sup>rd</sup> student on the SSC who was not an ASB officer.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said that the rules say that the classroom teachers have to be in the majority.</p>
<p>&#8211;Students could be represented by one ASB officer and 1 other student.</p>
<p>&#8211;Vote—unanimous to follow the UBC guidelines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Head Meeting</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Master Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy talked about changing course titles and the affect it would have on School Loop.  No changes will be made until after this grading period.  Next grading period she will communicate with everyone on how to do the changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked for the number of changes in names.  Nancy said there are some in Science, some in ELD, College and Career, Math.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Communications will come from Nancy about moving to Synergy.  Counselors will go to classes during the 3<sup>rd</sup> week of January.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Peer Observation Feedback</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa asked the group for feedback.  How did it go, was it useful and meaningful?</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said we have a lot of talent in the building and he liked going and seeing how other teachers do things.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said English loves it and it is really beneficial for the new teachers.  She thinks it is a low-key way of guiding new teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said it was good for his department.  There are a lot of good teachers in the building and it is good to get new ideas.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said it is really good for the new teachers.  He felt they should be encouraged to do more of this activity.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said some teachers do not want to observe other teachers and do not want to be observed unless it is for an evaluation.  He has heard this as a UBC rep.</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat said there were a few of his teachers who went across curriculum and they found it helpful.  David said that also happened in his department.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said it is fantastic to see what is going on in other classrooms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Instructional Leadership</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa asked how can we move to support instruction more in this school?  How can we structure this in the future?  She said she is not an expert in all subjects.  What are the members’ ideas for supporting instruction in the school?</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said some of the work done in departments could be modeling how to teach a lesson.  Most of the work includes business, or CFA’s, cluster meetings.  The way CPT is structured now, there is not time for supporting instruction with a teacher sharing the modeling of a lesson.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said there used to be district wide PD’s by department and members did some instruction and demonstrations.  He felt we could put on our own here at Galileo.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned what they did last year—observing other teachers in his department in the Fall and then teaching them a lesson in the spring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Spring CPT Time</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa distributed the plans for Spring 2013.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked about “The Amazing Race at Galileo.”  Lisa said this comes from an activity she did in graduate school and she discussed trivia questions about Galileo, staff, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said “The Curricular Planning in Teams” is too vague.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa would like everyone to take this back to their departments for feedback.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked about the April 10 and 11 Common Core State Standards Planning. Lisa said these are coming and will be a reality.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa explained the Peer Observation Planning.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan would like one of the CPT sessions in the spring to be a Retirement Planning session to present new guidelines.  Lisa asked everyone to bring it up with their departments.</p>
<p>&#8211;Please give her feedback by Tuesday 11/13/12.</p>
<p>&#8211;She asked everyone to please turn in the sign-in sheets from your meetings.  She is also trying to learn where the student teachers are each period.  She distributed the sign-in sheets.  She also asked if the minutes from all meetings are being taken and turned in.  She has not received any of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Feedback on CLAs</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat said the CLAs was a good learning activity for his department.  He felt they need to devote more meeting time to select questions.  In order for the results to be more meaningful, there needs to be more planning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said the Chemistry CLAs were mirroring what Mat said.  They had more discussions on the questions, rather than the results.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said some of his teachers were more serious about the CLAs than others and then how they presented it to the students.  Part of the grade or not part of the grade?  They will work on a cohesive strategy for addressing the CLAs.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph used assessments they are already giving and did not design a new test.  This was part of the curriculum and grades.  Kathleen said her department did the same.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said they are seeing more from the CFAs and this is working for them.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said he noticed the scores going up in the afternoons.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus thanked everyone for going through the process.  This is about teaching and reflecting on what we are doing.  He said the PTSA was asking for this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat said they felt that some of their questions were not very good.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle wants to use the same questions to see if there is improvement in the spring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:40am.</p>

<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>Go Giants!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Wellness/UCSF School Wide Agenda</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica and Susan presented information about the Substance Abuse Assembly last year.  They said this was the best assembly on this topic they have ever seen.  They would like to bring this one back and the presenter is loyal to Galileo.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica said that if a student is caught using drugs illegal substances on campus, they are assigned to 3 substance abuse sessions.  We have 35 cases so far this year.</p>
<p>&#8211;They explained the physiology of what illegal substances do to the body.  The students were really engaged.  They way he presents the subject is memorizing to the students and the adults.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica said this is the last year he can present to Galileo as he is finishing his residency.  He can bring 40 residents with him this year from UCSF.  They can come for a morning on a block day.  The date is March 21<sup>st</sup>.  We need to let them know as soon as possible.  We have never had a double assembly schedule on a block day.</p>
<p>There would be debriefings by the 40 residents.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica asked the group what they think of this.  Wellness had never done a school-wide assembly.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan suggested that we not have block schedule that week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested flip flopping Tuesday and Thursday that week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ms. Maroun has a theater presentation that week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed about various possible schedules.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested running 4 assemblies so they are smaller.  Smaller audiences usually mean the kids are more focused.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said he is concerned about moving the kids in smaller groups.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica will bring back several schedule options in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan said the presenter touches on all disciplines—math, science, English, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan suggested 3 assemblies on a block day with prep materials, but the presenters are only able to be here in the morning.</p>
<p>&#8211;The presenter’s perspective is from the ER and what happens with substance abuse and what they see in the ER.</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan said she has never seen this great a program in all the 40 years she has been working with youth and families.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen would like to get prep materials so they can have them translated.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus thanked Jessica and Susan for their work on this.</p>
<p>&#8211;The presenter will do a presentation for the staff ahead of the student presentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Assembly Bell Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked for feedback from the group.</p>
<p>&#8211;ELD liked #5, Social Studies #5, Math #1and #5, English and VPA did not discuss.</p>
<p>David said anything would be fine.  World Language said that as well.</p>
<p>&#8211;Decision made, Schedule #5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       CPT/PD Committee</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked everyone to think about how we develop the CPT/PD calendar for the future.  We need to look at needs and priorities for the school.  Please discuss with your department.  We will discuss at next meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Food Fest Parameters</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen asked about homemade food.  Mr. Wing said that is not allowed. The student nutrition policy says homemade food is OK.  She also asked about sugar, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan brought the nutrition guidelines.  She also emailed everyone the guidelines.  She talked about the terrible food our students eat and the huge obesity problem in our youth today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Entrees from homemade food and restaurants are OK, but anything else must meet the student nutrition guidelines.</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan talked about events in the past where students ate healthy food.  She mentioned some foods that she felt students would buy.</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked if the system now is on the “honor system?”  Marcus said they sell the junk on those 4 days at other schools.  He has been talking to students in the hallways about selling candy by clubs and classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan said public law is involved.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica said we were in the newspaper several years ago for not following the nutrition guidelines.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle thought the sponsors of clubs should have these guidelines sent to them again.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug felt that the meetings prior to food fests address what is acceptable to sell and what is not.  Many teachers and sponsors do not know what was allowed and what is not allowed.</p>
<p>&#8211;David felt it would be good to have a list of ingredients at sales or nutritional information.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we would put out a concise email about this topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Head Agenda</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Budget Check-In (Google doc)</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie asked everyone if they got the document.  She asked if anyone has questions.</p>
<p>She said that most of the money went into supplies.  Please let her know by the end of the day tomorrow what you need.  She needs to lump all the departments together this time.  She will do budget transfers and these will then be reflected on the Google doc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked about Bio Tech and how much money they need.  He mentioned a number of pieces of equipment that he needs repaired.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said Science always needs more money than other departments.  At other schools, many departments always chip in to Science.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Department Budget Allocations</p>
<p>&#8211;David said Science has to spend all their money on supplies.  They do not have the option of field trips, sending teachers to PD, etc., because of the consumables they use every year.  He feels it is an equity issue and doing the allocations based on just the number of students does not meet the needs of the Science Department.  He is asking for a “bump” above the other departments.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug agreed with David.  He also mentioned that we used to have a “tech” budget but we no longer have this.  He must replace computers with his budget.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said they have to replace novels and she wants to see what funds are recovered for lost English books.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said the lost textbook recovery funds are not set by department and Connie keeps the records internally.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked for the process for asking for these funds.  Katie will check on this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said she would like to take charge of collecting funds for lost textbooks and then use these funds to purchase more books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David thought each department should have a basic operating funds and then the rest should be shared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat said what every his department has left over, they would share with the departments in need.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan mentioned past practices of larger classes getting more supplies.  The SSC decides if the money goes to teachers or supplies.</p>
<p>&#8211;Leah said if we need money for supplies to effectively teach the classes, then we might not have money for conferences, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked what the department budgets are for this year.  Katie referred to the Google doc for the information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug asked how Katie broke the budget down.  She said it was based on the number of students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said we never see any accounting on the club accounts.  Katie said it is listed on the outside of the accountant’s door.  It is updated weekly.  Joseph suggested it should be put on a Google doc.  Katie said the accountant uses accounting software that we do not have.</p>
<p>&#8211;David suggested we find out if she can present this information to us digitally.  Question was asked as to whether we want this information public.</p>
<p>&#8211;Class sponsors should know accountability for class funds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said many of the departments have special needs and could make a pitch as to why they need extra funds.  Katie will rearrange the funds as to how the departments want.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug suggested Science identify the dollar amounts per student for consumables in chemistry, biology, etc.  Discussion followed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said Biotech needs $3,000-$5,000 for consumable supplies.  Bio Tech 2 is more expensive than Bio Tech 1.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie reminded everyone that we might be looking at further budget cuts if the election results are not positive on Prop 30 and Prop 38.</p>
<p>&#8211;The question was asked—“Should we spend now?”  The answer is yes.  Downtown can freeze the budget any time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked David to do his bare bones budget and let him see it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III        Master Scheduling</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said Eleanor MarBeshears is taking on the scheduling of the Academies.  This will begin the first week in January.</p>
<p>&#8211;Counselors will visit classrooms the week of January 21<sup>st</sup> to register students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked if the counselors would visit the English classes.  Nancy said that has always been the easiest as everyone takes English.  This is over a 2-3 week span.</p>
<p>&#8211;Counselors will email the English teachers and the teachers will say when is the best time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about scheduling for AP and Honors classes—how or will we recruit for those classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Students should sign up for Honors and AP classes they want and then schedule changes will only happen the first 3 weeks of school.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said she is supposed to be done with the Master Schedule by May.</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked about the window for AP teachers getting a prep or a stipend.  Marcus and Nancy will discuss this and let the members know.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug mentioned that some kids sign up for classes they are not capable of taking.  Screening should happen by March.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy mentioned problems with the district SIS.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked if anyone had a problem with changing the meeting to Wednesdays.  It would involve a change of prep periods for the members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Course Titles</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy will need to change course titles.  She asked for help in this process.  When she changes titles, grades disappear from School Loop.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said you can merge the classes before they begin.  Discussion followed on processes and problems.</p>
<p>&#8211;Some name changes are necessary so students get the proper credit.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug suggested Nancy work with someone from School Loop and then we have a process to walk teachers through this. These changes must be done before the end of the semester.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         CFA Analysis CPT</p>
<p>&#8211;Next Wednesday we will do CFA Analysis.  You can look at English and Math or whatever you like.  Lisa will get Data for any group that wants it.  Lisa will provide a goal and questions departments of clusters can ask.  Look at the assessments and work with your information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus would like to know the location of each cluster meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Creative Clustering</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa asked Michelle to talk about how the English Department does clustering—Clusters are set up by grade level.  Some teachers are teaching multiple levels, but each teacher will focus on one grade level.  They will focus on one project.</p>
<p>&#8211;In each cluster someone is appointed as the leader to take attendance, take notes, and report back to the whole department.</p>
<p>&#8211;Last week they worked with the “Thesis Statement.” Everyone reported back.  Then they talk about what has to be scaffolded.  She tries to focus on everyone doing the same thing, except for grade level.  Now it is transitioning into grade level appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said clusters happen twice a month.  He asked if once a month was enough for Special Ed.  They may not have time for 2 clusters per month.  He asked the members for their thoughts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII.      Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug mentioned that Ray has students take the STAR test and this is the honest and direct way to do this.  Other schools do not all do this.  We are looking good.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray mentioned the CMA test and the scores.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa talked about Spec. Ed. students with IEP’s who are in regular classes.  We need to open the lines of communication between regular teachers and Special Ed teachers.  Having Spec. Ed. teachers going to clusters is helping.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said there should be leveling of Special Ed students between classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said there should be a cap for each class and he mentioned 10%.</p>
<p>&#8211;He said some of the Regular Ed teachers are cooperative and others are not, so some classes have more Special Ed students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:45am.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Winter Assembly Date</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph talked about the suggestions of dates for the Winter Assembly.  He sent a survey to the staff and he found 45% wanted it to be Dec. 2st and 40% wanted the last day of “Dead Week”—Dec. 14<sup>th</sup>.  He felt there would be more attendance at the Assembly if we did it Dec. 14<sup>th</sup> and run 2 assemblies.  If we did it on Dec. 21<sup>st</sup> we would probably just have 1 assembly.</p>
<p>&#8211;Science does not want to give up teaching time, so David said that his department wants Dec. 21<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said that many students do not want to come on Dec. 21<sup>st</sup>.  Even performers may not show up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked about the Holiday Door Decorating Contest.  He suggested we reinstate it.  He asked for an opinion from the group.  He suggested each member check with their departments.  The last several times we had the contest there was little participation.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray suggested that anyone could enter, not just homeroom door decorating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Assembly Bell Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug distributed options for a new assembly schedule.  He explained the 5 options by moving time around so that the afternoon classes were not 10 minutes longer than the morning classes.</p>
<p>-Option 1 has all classes at 50 minutes, except 3<sup>rd</sup>.  We need to keep lunch from being too late for the cafeteria workers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Option 2 has all lunch between the assemblies.  This is problematic for those leading groups.  This option is out.</p>
<p>&#8211;Option 3 shortens the 2<sup>nd</sup> assembly by 5 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Option 4 has all classes 50 minutes and lunch is shortened 5 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Option 5 and 6—5 lunch is 40 minutes and 6 lunch is 50 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug felt Option 1 is the best choice.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan expressed concern if the assemblies go over time.  We cannot reduce lunch to less than 40 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa asked why the assembly is 4<sup>th</sup> period.  One answer is those in charge have 4<sup>th</sup> period prep, and 4<sup>th</sup> period is right before lunch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked for the next steps.  David suggested it go to the departments for their input.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Electronic Sign-In</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said he would like to bring this up as mornings are rushed and teachers need time to get set up before 8am.  He suggested an electronic sign-in for teachers once they arrive in their rooms.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he would think about it.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said he could make it so that they say where they are when they sign in.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy asked if Bettie would be able to see easily which rooms are not covered.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray asked if it is that hard to come in and sign-in in the office.</p>
<p>&#8211;Leah said it would be complicated to have Bettie look at the computer and the sign-in book.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug explained that many teachers come in on the other side of the building and it is extra time to come to the Main Office and sign-in.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan talked about when he injured his back and how he did it.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph would like to see something that was a card swipe several places in the building. David said there were logistical issues with this.  He suggested a spreadsheet where everyone could put their initials in.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the administration would get back to the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Parking Enhancements</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug suggested a parabolic mirror, which would help see if there are parking places available and we could see students coming.</p>
<p>&#8211;He also suggested that the gate have an AA2 key on it so that teachers could go in and out.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan said it is illegal to have the area locked.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug suggested a push bar to get out.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said that area is locked during the school day so that outside visitors cannot enter that way.  Rebecca opens it at lunchtime for access to the field.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we would do a little research.  The parabolic mirror is a good idea.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan said we need 2 of them.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie asked Doug to find online what we need and she will make it work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan addressed the problems that happen with how people park and also on game days people come and block others in.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said they would talk to security and have them help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Master Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said she was called downtown yesterday to learn about Synergy, which will be the new SIS.  It will begin in the summer, but training will be in the Spring.  Deadlines will be moved up to earlier dates and this will make for a smoother transition in Fall 2014 and schedules would be set by May 30<sup>th</sup>.  Teachers going off for summer break would know what they are teaching exactly in the fall.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy spoke of dates the district would use for enrollment as well as how many of each group of students we would have.</p>
<p>&#8211;We would create on the old SIS system and then the district will convert to Synergy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Questions followed—concerning IT support, why can’t we build on Synergy, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug asked about the advantages of Synergy.  Nancy said the system will list ideal schedules and Nancy won’t have to figure it out.  It will have online attendance now so there will be no more attendance strips.</p>
<p>&#8211;There will be phone applications</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said that SIS is a “stands alone” system used only by SFUSD.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie also said Synergy is also a company that is nation wide.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said it is web based and teachers have more access to records.  Teachers would see immediately who was absent, excused, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said it is like a college system and students will be able to register for classes on line.  San Diego and Long Beach School Districts use Synergy. Those districts are 3 times as large as SFUSD.</p>
<p>&#8211;One concern is that not every classroom has a computer, so attendance could be an issue.  The union is looking into this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy is willing to start early.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked how this would affect the counselors when they come into the classrooms to register students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said we would be making placement decisions based on just the fall classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Members asked about training and when it would happen.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said that there would still be mass changes in the Fall.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said this is a huge transition but one that needs to happen.  Nancy said they have been planning this for 2-3 years.</p>
<p>&#8211;David went to selection meetings on this and he said the fast transition is the best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        College Counselor</p>
<p>&#8211;We are going to get a counselor to help with those students who are in the middle.  This is being paid for with extra money from the district.  His name is Donald Harper.  He will make sure they are focused.  He will focus on Seniors and Juniors and then in the Spring with the lower classmen.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan explained the financing that the SSC authorized.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said this is a Classified Position and not a counselor.</p>
<p>&#8211;This counselor will be working with targeted students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Head Agenda</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          CFAs</p>
<p>&#8211;October 31<sup>st</sup> will be CLA, CFA and Data Analysis for CPT.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he had Social Studies and World Languages.  He is waiting for the others.  Please email or turn in paper assessments to Lisa.</p>
<p>&#8211;Every teacher should be giving some form of CFA’s between now and October 31<sup>st</sup>&#8212;Stan said their CFAs were done as the Final Exam.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said they agreed to just give the exam knowing that some of the students will not know all of the information.</p>
<p>&#8211;Department discussions will happen on October 31<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Part I was to make the assessments.  Part II will involve Data Director.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus gave a demonstration of Data Director.</p>
<p>&#8211;Leah asked how much time they would get to enter data.  David said last year the administration was going to do it for the teachers.  Marcus said he could do it.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked about VPA and PE where the assessments are not multiple-choice questions.  Lisa will look into it.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he inputted a 30-question test in 13 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus explained the scanning process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Back to School Night</p>
<p>&#8211;It is tonight and Nancy said she has not heard from too many who can’t come.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle wanted to know if there would be an announcement at the end of 6<sup>th</sup> period for parents to get the report cards.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said parents will register, fill out lunch applications, tour the Resource Fair, then go to the Auditorium, then Classroom Visits, then the Report Cards.  There are student helpers.  Report Cards will be given out in the Van Ness Gym.</p>
<p>&#8211;Resource Fair Tables will be in the Main Hallway.</p>
<p>&#8211;School Loop training will be in 260.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       College Fair</p>
<p>&#8211;October 12<sup>th</sup>.  Seniors are expected to go and will be back 5<sup>th</sup> period.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked if Seniors are excused tomorrow.  They need a Field Trip Form.</p>
<p>&#8211;A list of students who are not going will be given out tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        PSAT</p>
<p>&#8211;October 17<sup>th</sup>.  All 10<sup>th</sup> graders and 60 11<sup>th</sup> graders.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said they are giving their CLA’s next week and this is an issue.  They like to do it on a block day.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa can get an extension on the CLA.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan has a concern about using his room on 10/17 for testing, when he had a lab planned.  Nancy said most of his students would be taking the PSAT.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said it was challenging scheduling the rooms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Peer Observations</p>
<p>&#8211;The UBC said they would be interested in bringing these back.  She asked everyone to think about who they would like to observe, etc.  Lisa passed around a sign-up sheet. She hoped the newer teachers could observe some of the more experienced teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa asked them to take this to their department meetings.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa brought some examples of the tools for Peer Observations and she passed them out.  She wants input from the group.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said a mini National Teaching Standards would be helpful.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested printing it on legal size paper with the tear off on the top.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle discussed the English Dept. form that the administration uses.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked if it was required that everyone use the same form.</p>
<p>&#8211;The administration will not see what the teachers write to each other.</p>
<p>&#8211;What did you like? What can I do better? and What I didn’t like are 3 areas Joseph mentioned.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle suggested keeping criticism or dislikes off the form.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug asked if the Math Dept. could devise a form and the answer is Yes as long as there is a tear-off portion at the top.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa distributed more information for members to check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;District and state all have different definitions for accommodations and modifications.</p>
<p>&#8211;CMA is considered a modified exam.  Katie has the clarifications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:45am.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team/Department Heads Meeting</span></strong></p>
<p align="right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>9/27/12</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Academic Honesty</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we are missing some members, so we will table this until our next meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Vending Machines</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said money is tight this year.  The Senior Class needs to raise $14,000 for graduation.  Mr. Wing would like to have a public vending machine.  The administration would like to have a vending machine.  Drinks for ASB and snacks for the administration are the focus.</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked where they would be.  We need to place them where students would not be able to use them during class.  Marcus felt there was a space outside by Room 210.  Nancy suggested by the Deans’ Office.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked if this could be opened up to ROTC, PE, music, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked who the supervisors would be—counting money, depositing money, unjamming the machines, stocking the machines, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica said there are only a few vendors we can use due to student nutrition guidelines.  We have to follow the guidelines, and we can only use-approved foods.</p>
<p>These foods and machines are listed on the SFUSD website under Student Nutrition.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica said that they may not be open during lunchtime as that would conflict with the cafeteria.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan will look into private sponsorship from outside vendors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Lunch Forms</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus would like a way to get more students to fill out the applications.  This will bring us more money.</p>
<p>&#8211;Suggestions made to bring this up at Back to School Night.  Nancy said there are many advantages besides the food—fee waivers for SAT, AP exams, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica asked about those who do not qualify.  She also asked about the competition Karin Lau did a few years ago with the homeroom competition and the winner having a pizza party.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan said that PE would take this on.  They do a Field Trip Permission Slip that is required.  So he could require the Lunch Form as well.</p>
<p>&#8211;Both the paper form and the online form have a quick check for “Not Eligible.”</p>
<p>&#8211;Deadline for this year has already passed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said it might be possible to hand the form out at Back to School Night.</p>
<p>&#8211;David suggested giving them out to 8<sup>th</sup> grade parents in the Spring.  This would only work if the state has the forms ready.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        PSAT</p>
<p>&#8211;October 17<sup>th</sup> in the morning.  This is a mandatory test for all 10<sup>th</sup> graders.  There are 60 slots for 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> graders.  The reason the students have to take it here at school is the district wants to increase our SAT scores and some students cannot afford the prep sessions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Back to School Night</p>
<p>&#8211;October 11<sup>th</sup> from 5pm-8pm.  Faculty only needs to be here for what they are responsible for.  For the Resource Fair, use student representatives. This activity will be around the auditorium perimeter.  This is 5pm-5:25pm.  Anybody can participate.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said there might be better teacher participation if there were 2 Early Release days for teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Day before is the Early Release Day, so teachers can leave at 2:10pm.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said that he is glad that we are doing this in the 10<sup>th</sup> week of the school and passing out report cards.  He believes we will get a big turn out and he likes the fact that the report cards will be delivered at the end of the event.</p>
<p>&#8211;A postcard to families is going out today.  On this notice, there was no agenda listed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked if other schools were doing this the same week as we are.  Marcus said that most of the schools have already done this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked the Department Heads to encourage all teachers to attend.  If any teachers cannot attend, please arrange coverage.  Nancy would like to know which teachers will not be present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Schedule Changes</p>
<p>&#8211;There are a handful of schedule changes for the next grading period.  After School Loop closes on Wednesday we will place those changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Department Heads should give a list of changes to Nancy by Monday.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked if he would get a print out of grades before October11th for athletic eligibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII.      Data Report</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus passed out the API over view.  This has last year’s results and this year’s results.  We will do a data review at next Wednesday’s faculty meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked for feedback.</p>
<p>&#8211;We started out at 780, with a target of 785 and we went to 791.  Our target is 796 this year.</p>
<p>&#8211;In 2010 year, we are 7 3, 3 out of 10 in similar schools.  In 2011 we are a 5—a good gain.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said more lunch forms we have will help with the similar schools rank.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph talked about the 13 points the English Language Learners achieved.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus mentioned the Latino Students and the huge accomplishment they achieved.  They went up 50 points.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said there is a Latino support club that came from the Latino Club.  We have more Latino students in AP class than we have had in the past.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren said everyone went up, except Asian students stayed the same and students with disabilities did not go up.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we did very well with our White students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked about gender changes over the years.  Nancy said we have more females than in the past.</p>
<p>&#8211;David felt that when the population shifts, it does affect the test scores.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy gave information on which programs have more males or females.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked about the number 100 for group size.  Marcus said the group size is 100 or 10% of population and that becomes significant.</p>
<p>&#8211;David mentioned a past practice of selecting 2 low scoring students and focusing on them.  He asked if this had any effect.  We have since stopped doing this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said he felt Loan Ly has been a great articulator for the Asian students who are going un-served.  These students know how to slide.  David mentioned a group of students he saw yesterday that are not in class, but not causing trouble—the one he saw was all male ELD students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick suggested a Vietnamese class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VIII.     Emergency Procedures Week</p>
<p>&#8211;The Great California Shakeout is Thursday, October 18<sup>th</sup> between 8:30am and 9:00am.  We will miss the 10:18am siren.  We are moving the time up due to the ELD Picnic and Activity.</p>
<p>&#8211;We will duck and cover, then evacuate to the football field.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie would like to do a Lock Down, a Fire/Bomb Drill that same week.  All the drills will involve evacuation.  David said it would be good practice for lining up on the field.</p>
<p>&#8211;Fire and Bomb are virtually the same.  We evacuate for both and kids could be dismissed to their parents or not.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie would like to do Monday and Tuesday, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IX.        Administrative Protocol for Sharing Information</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat mentioned a threat that happened this week and he has heard about students making a threat on the school, and the FBI getting involved.  His department would like to know the information is passed to the faculty.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said the teachers who had the students were told.  The administration did not want the kids to have notoriety from other students.  The students were suspended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Head Agenda</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Textbook Accountability</p>
<p>&#8211;David said the book problems in his department, AP Biology and Physiology, involved books that were misplaced or borrowed.  In general we all try to do the best job we can.</p>
<p>&#8211;Administration wants to continue the process as it has been done in the past.  The inventory will continue, probably electronically.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said we will have textbook loss no matter what system we have.  There are things we cannot control.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said in the past Central Office would help with this, but now they are putting it back to the schools.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said in the past every 5 years new textbooks were adopted.  This has not happened and some of them are 10 years old.  The old textbooks are no longer available for purchase.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus suggested Department Heads press this issue in their district meetings.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen gives points in her department for cleaning out lockers and finding books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         CLA Updates</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we are going to continue to meet the window and hope everyone is giving some kind of Common Formative Assessment in the time frame.  We want to get it into Data Director.  Goal is for teachers to have discussions around CFAs.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said they would use Social Studies as the pilot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen asked about truancy and who should be notified.  Nancy said to notify the counselor.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said they are starting their tutoring program and she passed out information about this program.</p>
<p>&#8211;David offered clarification on the science class names.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said the departments will get some money.  We have 50 more students and funds will come to WSF, SCE and LEP.</p>
<p>&#8211;David discussed the needs of each department and they are all different.  He wanted to bring this up to the departments to see what they need, and then spread out the extra funds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:30am.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team/Department Heads Meeting</span></strong></p>
<p align="right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>9/13/12</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          School-Wide Academic Honesty Policy</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked other district principals for their policies.  He felt the Balboa policy was the most comprehensive.  He distributed other schools’ policies as well so that all departments could read them and discuss them.  Marcus asked everyone to take this to their departments for discussion regarding additions, deletions, etc.  The goal is to have a school-wide policy for academic honesty.  We will revisit this at the next meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the Deans would also like to be involved in this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Textbook Accountability</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked everyone to present how their department is tracking textbooks and holding teachers and students accountable.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said they use the orange lost book cards.  They do a count at the end of the year.  He felt that teachers should track their own books and be accountable.  Everyone has access to the book room.  Some teachers keep their books in their rooms.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen has a Textbook Record Sheet with the numbers on the sheet.  They do an inventory at the end of the year.  They use the orange lost book cards.  All books are kept in the book room and all teachers have access.</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat said his teachers use the book numbers and the orange cards. Some are in the bookroom and some are in classrooms.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan said the books are in the Fitness Lab and the teachers rotate.  They check books out to the students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said they do not have a state approved textbook.  If students want to take guitars home, they fill out an orange book card.  His art classes do not have books.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said for Special Ed the books are in the classroom.  If students check books out, the teacher fills out a sheet.  They have 15 books for each class.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said they have textbooks and novels.  Teachers keep textbooks in their rooms.  Very few teachers use the textbooks.  They mostly use the novels.  The novels have numbers and are assigned to students.  Lost book numbers are sent to Connie in an electronic form.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said they used to have a budget to replace novels.  In the past the teacher collected the money and replaced the novels.  They have stopped doing that now.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said teachers can keep books over the summer in a locked cabinet in their rooms.  Some teachers use the orange lost book cards.  Some teacher keep track electronically.  For transfer students from one class to another the teachers exchange the book numbers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Leah said they use the orange lost book cards for the textbooks.  For the novels the teachers keep track.</p>
<p>&#8211;Science and math had textbook needs this year.  Michelle said her department signs up ahead of time for the novels.  Due to higher class sizes, some of the teachers cannot teach the novels they want to, due to lack of books.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus mentioned a small amount of money in the lost textbook fund.  Let him know if you have needs.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus talked of a former school that was moving towards a central system that had a barcode system initiated by the librarian.</p>
<p>&#8211;David spoke of a system he experienced at another school.  All teachers had a scanner and a central person in charge of the books.  He feels a digital system will work.  Every book must have a bar code and be added to a database.  This database should be linked up to SIS.  School Loop does not have this capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus will ask other principles.  We are getting pda’s donated to us.  This is like a personal computer you can hold in your hand.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said at one time the English Department had a book clerk who checked the books in and out</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said that perhaps there could be a system that operates like the library system.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said this is a statement by the district in the Librarian Job Description indicating this is not part of the Librarian’s duties.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie discussed her work in the math and science department book rooms.  She feels the departments must have their own book storage areas and the accountability should be with each department.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned the Senior Sign-Out process and wondered if we could do this each year with each grade.  Marcus said the big deal for seniors is graduation.</p>
<p>&#8211;Many students who transfer do not return the books.  Marcus said it is against the law to withhold a student’s cum folder.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the district is putting a lot of pressure on each department to save money and keep track of the resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       7-Step Schedule Change Process</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat said there are many students attempting to leave AP classes as they say the classes are too hard.  He said Barry Barbour has been working with Mat.  The recommendation is to move from AP to regular, not Honors, as students should not get their second choice.  He mentioned students bringing in their parents to put pressure on the teacher.  Mat asked for administration back up.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said in the Spring they look at course requests and then we build the Master Schedule around the requests.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked what the time frame is for the 7 Step Process.  Lauren said often students request a change from one class and that will affect all their classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Most members like the process.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said the AP issue is also contractual—if a class drops below 25 then the teacher would not get the extra prep.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the term “due process.”  Lauren explained it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Night School/Cyber High Update</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren said students have been registering.  Cyber High will launch next week and there will be 3 sessions.  Social Studies is not available for Night School. Tomorrow is the last day of registration.</p>
<p>&#8211;No class size will go above 38, but there are always those who drop out.</p>
<p>&#8211;Juniors and Sophomores can sign up if there is room.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren mentioned the classes available with Night School and she sent an email to everyone mentioning the classes.  Students who received F’s or D’s can sign up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Final Exam Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed last year’s schedule, with some changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus suggested having a shorter break between the two exams and an earlier dismissal.</p>
<p>&#8211;Grades will be due Thursday 12/20/12.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick questioned make-up exams and grade changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug mentioned that we might get by with just one Winter Assembly.  David suggested that we plan for 2 and then go to 1 if we can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Administration Responsibilities</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed the advised administration responsibilities due to change in personnel and exchanges of duties.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said it will be posted on line.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said Katie has taken on some testing and supporting Spec. Ed.  Lisa is taking up technology support.  Marcus thanked Bettie for learning the web site and Word Press.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie also passed out the Clerical Responsibilities</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII.      CELDT Testing Update</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa gave an update on how the testing is going.  Lisa thanked Ethan and Patrick for their contributions.  Karen and Rodolfo Cancino and Nancy Statler are doing the testing in Room 119.  Lisa explained the process of calling students from classes for the testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VIII.     Emergency Plan Review</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie told the group that the administrators will visit each department meeting today to talk about the Emergency Evacuation Plan.  Hopefully there will be a folder in each classroom.  There are not many changes.  Katie explained the posting process in the classrooms and the evacuation route needs to be posted.</p>
<p>&#8211;All Department Heads told where their meetings are held.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed on the recent evacuation we just experienced and how we did.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned one line of the evacuation map that is confusing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IX.        PD Calendar</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa distributed the PD calendar.  It will be presented to the UBC this afternoon.  This is a draft.  She thanked Leah and Michelle for help in including lots of requests from all of the departments.</p>
<p>&#8211;Wednesdays are mostly school-wide activities.  They will be school-wide activities.</p>
<p>&#8211;Thursdays are teacher days, with teacher requests.  Thursdays will be the same each month.</p>
<p>&#8211;School Loop time is always factored in when grades are due.  Lindsay Silverman is helping with School Loop training.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen mentioned the October 18<sup>th</sup> ELD activity and the fact that they need to prepare for it the day before.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said that clusters are mainly held during department time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said his department does not use clusters.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan mentioned that “time earned” for the October Open House is not reflected in the schedule.  Report cards will be distributed at the Open House.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed about how to name each item on the calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>X.         Evaluation Packets</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked about the number of evaluations this year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked if the teacher had a choice about the short or long evaluation.  Last year the administrators did all long forms.  This year they would like to do some short forms, but do not know how to select each one.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick suggested they read the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Head Meeting</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          ELD Feedback &amp; Next Steps</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said she got feedback from yesterday’s PD.  She said she is excited about giving some teachers at school leadership opportunities.  She would like to see this work continue.  How do we move forward with this?  How do we propel this work forward?  What engagement strategies can we use that engage students and not take much time?</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion of alternatives followed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said he enjoys going into other teachers’ classrooms and seeing how they teach to their students.  He feels it is really effective.  He mentioned focusing the Peer Observation Component in a discussion following the activity.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray felt the leadership opportunities for staff is great.  He was surprised about the assumptions teachers have about what the students know and do not know.  Each department will be different.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa thanked everyone for their feedback.  She said next week there will be similar workshops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said they will be looking for the Authentic Language Objectives when they do walk throughs. Kathleen asked about the monthly GLO’s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:40am.</p>

<p align="right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>8/30/12</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:15am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Updates</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Schedules</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren explained the reasons for the many schedule changes.  85% is done as of this morning.  It will all be done by the end of today.  Schedules will be distributed to the first period teacher.  Students will begin their new schedules first period tomorrow.  Teachers need to pick up their mail to distribute these schedules.  ELD and Math have the most changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren said some students may not want the changes.  There will be no students allowed in the Counseling Office unless they are registering or have an appointment slip.  Any changes will be made if they can be accommodated.  Most requests will be “no.”</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked if teachers would get a new class list.  Lauren said it will be on School Loop by 8am.  New class lists will come in a few days.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren will put out a notice about class lists on School Loop and the fact that it is the most accurate place for information.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said it is a good idea to make these many changes all at once.</p>
<p>&#8211;English had the most changes and Lisa said the English teachers were very accommodating to the changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug blamed the poor district assessments on the necessity for all the changes for the students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren thanked everyone for adhering to the Tuesday deadline.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>            <span style="text-decoration: underline">Night School</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren has teachers for English, Science and Math and still needs a Social Studies Teacher.  English—Peters and Kyle, Science—Rivera, Math—Liang.  Registration will begin September 10<sup>th</sup> and classes will begin on September 17<sup>th</sup>.  Lauren said each class will meet 2 times a week. Funding is coming from the district. The district has to offer credit recovery.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>            <span style="text-decoration: underline">Cyber High</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8211;This will be paid for by the district.  Lauren needs someone to organize this.  Allison Wagner did it last year. Lauren will send out an email.  No teachers for this program, only a coordinator.</p>
<p>&#8211;Students are allowed to do the course work at home, but must take the tests and quizzes at school.</p>
<p>&#8211;All students are able to take courses, but preference is given to seniors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Due Date for Fall Semester Grades</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle spoke for David.  She mentioned the online calendar notes grades are due at the end of the semester.  She mentioned last year that we had 3 days into the Spring semester to turn in grades.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned that teachers would give finals early if the grades are due at the end of the semester.  The last week would find many students in the halls, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said that district-wide grades do not go out on a particular level until all schools have turned them in.  Galileo and Lowell were the only high schools last year that did not turn in grades prior to the end of the semester.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the final exam schedule.  Bettie said we would have half days for Fall finals.  The schedule has been sent to the district to reflect this.</p>
<p>&#8211;The Friday of finals week will be the date for the Winter Assembly.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus suggested we table this item and discuss it next meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Grades will be due on Thursday so Connie can process the grades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Assembly Bell Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug talked about the schedule, with 45-minute classes for 1-4 and then periods 5 and 6 are 55 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed as to how to alter the schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Suggestion was made to have 60 minutes for lunch.  Katie said this is a safety issue, as the kids can get involved in activities off campus.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie asked Doug to put together several alternative schedules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Back to School Night</p>
<p>&#8211;October 11<sup>th</sup>.  Marcus distributed minutes from last year as to how everyone felt.  He also wants to discuss attendance.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked if the other schools were having their open houses on October 11<sup>th</sup>, and Marcus said that we are not in alignment with the rest of the district.</p>
<p>&#8211;Last year parents and students visited classes and other activities were going on.</p>
<p>&#8211;Some teachers gave their students extra credit for attendance.</p>
<p>&#8211;Parents will get the report cards at the end of the event.  That might help clear out the classrooms at the end of the event.</p>
<p>&#8211;Teachers do not discuss grades at this event.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug mentioned the fact that some parents do not follow the schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa suggested some guidelines for the teachers.  This is not for individual student conferences.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica asked about clubs and activities.  In a prior year they were in the cafeteria and no one came.  Her staff stayed for long hours.  She discussed the chaos for them in the cafeteria during the 9<sup>th</sup> grade orientation.  The main hallway or courtyard could be an alternative place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;All teachers are required to come to Back to School Night.  Some teachers have very valid reasons for not coming.  How do we cover their classes?  Ray said he has 3 teachers who attend evening classes and cannot come.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus suggested coverage can be arranged within the department.  Lisa said those teachers who will be absent should submit a sub plan.  Marcus suggested a video    or a power point.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa suggested waiting to see who could not come and deal with it on an individual basis.  Department Heads would coordinate who would cover each period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Head Agenda</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Centralized Book Accountability System</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said that the district has told us that we request more books than any other school in the district.  We need to have a better accountability system so we know what students and teachers do with their books.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug felt we need an accountability system here.  He said that we also need to know the attrition rate for wear and tear, lost books, etc.  Marcus said the district will put something together to show what we ask for.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked if we could use the money collected for lost books to buy new books.  Katie said we could but it is not that much money.  Now the money goes into the ASB account so we can pull funds from there for new books.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said we need to make teachers and students aware of the fact that we need to pay attention to the books and keep track of them.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen does a book round up at the end of the year and gives prizes for students who bring in extra books.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan says students who leave are responsible for many lost books.  He does not sign a card if the student does not return the book, but the student leaves anyway.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren said Freshmen were not given textbooks yet.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said the Math Dept. make the changes internally in their department.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked if we could hold the cum folder for a transfer student who does not turn in or pay for books.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie suggested letting Connie and Judie know that students do not get a transfer if the card is not totally signed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked for all members to bring their department procedure for dealing with textbooks and losses to the next meeting.  We will work on setting up a standardized procedure.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray asked for the funding sources for his paras.  He felt we lost 12 allocated hours.  We have more students now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         3-Day Lesson Plans &amp; Syllabus Submission</p>
<p>&#8211;Some of his teachers are complaining that they do this every year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said she will think about it.  But, she also mentioned that teachers teach different classes each year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said they would do it department wide.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said she could store the information and have the teachers review the plans and syllabus for next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said all syllabi are posted on School Loop.  Email or give a hard copy to Lisa.  Goggle Docs will work well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Class count—we are below where we need to be.  Wednesday, September 5<sup>th</sup> will be the district count.  Please emphasize with your teachers not to let students out of class.</p>
<p>&#8211;We are budgeted on 2072, and our last count was 1955.  Ray said with Spec. Ed. they have to go by SIS for the count.  Katie said they do “hot body” counts and we need all students in class.  The district will come and physically look at us.  The count will probably be 3°, and there could be more than one visit to each classroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;CELDT testing is going well.  Kathleen and her teachers are doing a lot of it.  In the coming week there will be 3 workers who will do the speaking portion of the test.</p>
<p>Students will be pulled in groups of 6 for a longer period of time.  We hope this will be less disruptive.</p>
<p>&#8211;September 20 and 21 will be the tests in class—ELD and English classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said all 400+ students need to be interviewed for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle talked about the Bathroom Passes.  When will we get them?  Katie said use the small white ones now, but the larger laminated passes are coming.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray writes his own pass.  Doug says he uses a piece of math equipment that is large.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said the teachers and students should know that the student has to ask permission to leave the classroom and receives something to take with them.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa suggested not leaving the passes, etc., right by the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned the PD calendar.  She said it is confusing for CPT when an email comes the evening before the activity.  Michelle asked for more than 24 hours notice.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa will post the activities on the Staff Calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus is getting very concerned about money.  We hoped for $120,000 and that is now down to $80,000.  We use lots of paper and Xerox machines.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we will monitor how much paper we use in the next 4 weeks.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug suggested Donors Choose, asking for paper.  He thought every teacher should do this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said there are no more extended hours, no more funds for field trips, no more mass mailings to parents (she will use School Loop).  Discussion of cuts followed. Mention was made of the cost of our Galileo Web and the possibility of using School Loop which is free but not as nice as our website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:30am.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 11:45am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Check-ins</p>
<p>&#8211;Each department talked about their numbers in each section.  Lauren mentioned possible solutions to balance the class sizes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion held about distribution of prep periods for teachers.  Many teachers no longer have first period prep.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren talked about the highest class sizes in each department.  Marcus asked if any periods have low student counts.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren said there will be a number of class changes and mid-week next week would be a good time to check with Lauren.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat asked for a remedial step to take with students who are high or under the influence.  Marcus said we only go to the police for a first offense if they are selling.  Otherwise they are sent to the Deans’ Office and sent home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray gave a good report from special ed.  Classes are leveled.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray asked members to tell teachers not to send kids out of class if they are not on the list, as they wander the halls and get in trouble.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray talked about team teaching. Get teacher buy-in. Some teacher(s) are not on board with team teaching. Michelle suggested planning year for two teachers to work together before launching on mapping curriculum.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray talked about caseload size being 2 over 28 for RSP. But moving 2 to SDC to lessen the caseload.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray encouraged teachers to come and see him with questions</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray overall having a good opening</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph: classes are slightly bigger, but hard to tell because student leveling is happening</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said the band is low; 7:30am meeting will be held tomorrow with Marcus, Joseph and Bob Novota.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David reported lots of movement, now starting to balance out.  He mentioned class cap confusion, so he will talk to Lauren about it.</p>
<p>&#8211;Clarification that students not have 2 science classes was discussed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Credit recovery is based on space in individual classes—Marcus</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         ELD changes</p>
<p>&#8211;Night School, seniors have priority</p>
<p>&#8211;David is a teacher whose been using out of compliance textbook, 130 shy of using adopted textbook. Asked if we should do a Lau law complaint? Marcus will put it on agenda; need to come up with book inventory system school wide; on agenda for next meeting</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said if you’re short books, dept. heads should email him so he can ask other schools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle has no major complaints other than copiers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle used CPT time to meet with new teachers yesterday; everyone is bringing class lists to talk about #s today after school during CPT time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned reservations about how teachers will be inputting school loop per principal expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen had CPT 2-4:30 meeting yesterday. Teachers are confused of Lau plan and rules. Mixups with ELD. Will impact all classes (the changes).</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said ELD classification list by teacher, will be handed out to teachers at next faculty meeting. Can get the list off of data director in “reports”, Jen Fong as author.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen will write “cheat sheet” of all codes and distribute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug mentioned a teacher concerned with how to teach ELD 5 kids. Doug will go over how to tell if they are ELD. Lisa will go over the specifics at this meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said that all freshmen have been tested. Graded, scored, entered data at CPT time yesterday. Will align it today at CPT time, students will be told on Friday of new placements.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug feels there are too many freshmen classes; consolidate into a higher level to balance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the 3 day count (check in) hot bodies 1906 + 200 absences (over average #), 30 of the absences are “no shows” and will be dropped.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said numbers are good and we will make the 2074 we were budgeted for.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie asked all dept. heads tell teachers to keep all kids in their room 3<sup>rd</sup> period.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie asked dept. heads to have teachers prep #s grade levels and absences, which is helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Room 206</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said lots of students come in. Asked to remind depts. of “no students” policy. No students on copy machines.  She mentioned the unlocked mailroom, which needs to be locked.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joe suggested signage for faculty and students</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        ELD Placement.</p>
<p>&#8212; Lisa is helping make sure that ELD students are placed correctly.  We will be out of compliance for placement of students incorrectly. Kids need to be moved out of courses into non-ELD courses.  She explained .8 classes are for ELD 1-5 (CELDT level 3 or lower). .6 non-English classes are for non-low level ELD and classes may have LTEL CELDT scores of 1.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen – general ed and .6 are lumped together.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa “party line” to relay to department: kids will be upset not being in a .8 class, and being in .6, remind them that it will be a tough situation that will be a learning one to improve their English. Exposure helps their language acquisition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Copy machines:</p>
<p>&#8211;Call Katie or Linda to locate Thong or Bounmy for fixes. Thong will status check machines in am and pm. Supplies not ordered will be ordered. Linda’s TAs will keep paper available. No staff to have a person dedicated nor someone dedicated during specific times.</p>
<p>&#8211;Emphasize: have a “jam” session where a teacher can teach during dept. mtgs on how to clear a jam; no kids copying; feedback requested.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa: said if there’s a jam in 206 that teachers notice, tell Lisa and she’ll tell Katie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 12:35pm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 12:15pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Walk Throughs</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus spoke about the history of the Walk Through tool and how it went last year.  He mentioned that the rating portion caused some discussion last year.</p>
<p>&#8211;David suggested Marcus email the teachers after a Walk Through and ask the teachers to come in for a conversation.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he will make it clear to the staff that he enjoys the conversations and will send the staff an email if he feels there should be a conversation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa asked for the process of Informal Walk Throughs, as she will be doing much of this on an informal basis.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said that it has pretty much been that visits are welcome and there is an open door policy.  She mentioned administrators who dropped a note to the teachers after a visit.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said it is a criterion for evaluation for administrators, so this year Marcus will have to show more documentation that the administrators are doing walk throughs.  Marcus will keep a copy of the document for his records.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said he would not want this to be part of a formal evaluation and would not want this to get into his personnel files.  He said he welcomes anyone to come to his classroom to observe.  This also helps with student management.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph also said that his department members have done walk throughs in his department.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug said that his department does this and does cover classes for each other so they can observe in other departments.</p>
<p>&#8211;The administrators were asked if they could help cover classes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         CLAs and Common Formative Assessments</p>
<p>&#8211;Testing window for CLAs is October 9 – 19<sup>th</sup>.  This is on the Staff Calendar.  All departments are giving some sort of assessments during this time.</p>
<p>&#8211;David mentioned that they have created a CLA for the Fall and for the Spring.  He also said that this was written for the end of the semester.  English and Math for 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> graders will happen in the October time period.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug asked about the hand written portion of the test. Lisa said she and Marcus would do some training to help teachers use the data.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked if the Common Formative Assessment has to be a scantron test.  Marcus said Joseph would have to do it by hand.  Joseph talked about his project based assignments.  Lisa suggested looking at particular sections of the rubric.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph would like to see Common Formative Assessments from other departments.  This would help in planning their test.</p>
<p>&#8211;David felt the goal of this is to see what we need to do better on.  We want to have the best use of our time.  Marcus said that some departments have activities in common while others do not.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested each department could pick their best assessment and share it with others.</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat asked if there would be another window for the non-Math/English assessments.</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat said his department did not want to do the assessment at the end of the semester, as there would not be time for changes.  Marcus will send out an email and everyone will have input for the timing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       School Loop Training</p>
<p>&#8211;Training on Thursday will include an intro class from 1:30pm-2:30pm.  The advanced training will be from 2:30pm on.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa has answers to some of the questions.</p>
<p>&#8211;By 3:30pm, everyone must have the syllabus up, send an email, post an assignment, upload a document (hopefully your syllabus), and your grading scale.</p>
<p>&#8211;Anyone who already knows how to do all of these activities does not have to go to the training, but all of these items must be posted by 3:30pm.  Two trainers will be here—one of them is the mother of one of our students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said he tried to post an assignment last night, but with no students listed it was not possible to post an assignment.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph brought up the issue of “intellectual property.”  He would like to hear from the union about this.  He feels that if he creates something on his home computer, he owns it.  Does it have to be copy writed?  There is not enough time to do all of this by 3:30pm tomorrow.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said it does not need to be the actual syllabus, but should know how to do the activity.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen feels the same as Joseph about the issue of “intellectual property.”</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said that documents do not have to be attached—just the basic assignment.  The title of the assignment would be fine.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said he felt this syllabus is his “intellectual property,” and he would like clarification from the union.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa mentioned that any work that you do on work time then becomes the property of the school/company, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he is not sure there is anything in the contract about this issue.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph felt that each individual has a right to their “intellectual property.”</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said the solution is to upload something resembling the document.  The syllabus is the document she would like uploaded.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed to change the language.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug mentioned that the Math Department would not be at school on Thursday, so Lisa will help on Friday</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        CST and Goal Setting</p>
<p>&#8211;You can look at your results, but we cannot share it until August 31<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked everyone to join a prediction activity—for the  CSTs write a prediction of what the CST will be for last year in each department. Marcus collected the predictions from each member.</p>
<p>&#8211;It was mentioned that the UCs might use CST results for English class placement.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus mentioned reading Schmoker last year and this will be an activity this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat mentioned that 6<sup>th</sup> period on Wednesday and Thursday next week would be 35 minutes, while all others are 50 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about department budgets—do we have any money?  Supplies will come out of a general area.  Katie said it was voted on last year that departments would relinquish their supplies to save a position.  Katie suggested Donor’s Choice as an alternative to get supplies, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 12:55pm</p>
