<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team/Department Heads Meeting</span></strong></p>
<p align="right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>3/9/12</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 11:20am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.            Budget</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we would give everyone 4 minutes to provide their feedback.  Everyone will be on a timer.  Then we will send Bettie’s notes to the SSC so they can read this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked for the process.  The Leadership Team’s feedback will be given to the SSC.  Ethan asked if the Leadership Tem would make a presentation to the SSC.  Marcus said the SSC will get the information from these notes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if we were taking a vote on our information.  Marcus and Katie indicated they have the budget sheets and the feedback from this Leadership Team meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if the administration was endorsing this proposal.  The answer is no.  Marcus said they listed all the scenarios on the budget sheets.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if the Yearbook and Journalism classes would go to after school activities.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony said they cut everything except what students need to graduate—A-G requirements.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben asked if there are some items we could all agree on prior to each department’s thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8211;Time reduced to 3 minutes per department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A.  Math</p>
<p>&#8211;Re: counselors—since parents were not aware of this—we have managed without them, so let’s continue this way.  Re:  Journalism and Yearbook—let’s do after school.  Re:  ROTC—if we discontinued this program, could we put them into PE.  Marti said she doesn’t know enough about the politics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B.  Lauren</p>
<p>&#8211;Para—to take away a para would be detrimental to the Counseling Office.; His duties include:  textbook collection/data; testing prep for AP, STAR, EAP, CELDT, CAHSEE (5XS), and all make-up tests.  He does all the cum folders, speaks 3 languages (Cantonese, Lao, Thai), answers the phone, fixes the copy machines does photocopying, helps with registration for incoming families and reclassifications for ELD.  Testing cannot continue in the counseling office if he is cut.  He is willing to take on more duties.</p>
<p>&#8211;Counseling cannot make a decision on cutting a para for a college counselor.</p>
<p>&#8211;AVID—why is this  program being cut when it is the only program to support students meet the A-G requirements.</p>
<p>&#8211;95% of AVID seniors graduate A-G and go to a 4-year college.  50% of senior class goes to a 4-year college .</p>
<p>&#8211;AVID 9 does not cost the school additional funds, as they would be taking Health Ed and College and Career. Now they do it on cyber high.  She can cut AVID 10 to one section.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren’s Case loads would be redesigned if AVID is cut.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C.  World Languages</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said they would like to have a teacher for teaching in the classroom rather than an extra counselor.  They are concerned about testing native speakers.  They are concerned about students testing out.  They do not want to lose teachers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>D.  VPA</p>
<p>&#8211;Wants the para position kept on rather than another counselor.</p>
<p>&#8211;He wants to support Ethan and PE and have the military stop dominating the situation.  He feels it is a wash whether we keep an ROTC teacher or a PE teacher.  He feels a fully credentialed PE teacher will be better than a special credential for the ROTC teacher.</p>
<p>&#8211;In the budget scenarios he does not like all the notes that say “No Change.”  He feels it should be all across the board.  Marcus said that Janet Schulze said that there will be no cuts in administrators.  Joseph felt that everyone should be cut equally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E.  PE</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan has always supported to ROTC program.  But, with 2 FTE cuts in PE it does not seem right. PE is a core curriculum course and 2 years are required for graduation.  ROTC is now an elective and PE credits are given in an Independent Study Program.  Sports team players also get Independent Study in PE for playing sports.</p>
<p>&#8211;His department said that class size would be increased if the Independent Study program was dropped.</p>
<p>&#8211;In 2014 a PE credential will be required for ROTC instructors.  We would be saving a temporary position for just 1 year if we keep ROTC.</p>
<p>&#8211;Students who do not pass 5 out of 6 content standards must take another year of PE.  This could affect 100-300 students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>F.  Library/UBC</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if the Asst. Superintendent has signed off on any cuts in administrative positions in our school as well as other schools.</p>
<p>&#8211;Given across the board 6.5% board cuts—where are they reflected ion non-classified and non –certificated at Galileo in secretaries and tech support?</p>
<p>&#8211;Can we look at the allocations and ratios for non-classroom staffing at other schools?</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said we were strongly encouraged to cut clerical.  We are fat compared to other schools.</p>
<p>&#8211;Are there any other monies in the school that can be applied to non=personnel?</p>
<p>&#8211;Does the administrative team consider credentialing, i.e. people’s jobs when making cuts?</p>
<p>&#8211;The superintendent said the cuts would be even across the board—he would like to see this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if there were paras doing work outside their content area.  The answer was Bounmy.  Most paras have classroom duties.  This could be a possible problem situation.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if the administration looked at credentials of all staff to see what switches could be made.  The answer was no.</p>
<p>&#8211;If the Library position goes to .4, the library would be open one period a day with one warehouse prep; probably not open at lunch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>G.            Karin</p>
<p>&#8211;Cuts should be all across the board.  This is not the right time to add a counselor.</p>
<p>&#8211;Karin said her position was being cut .6 and right now she does a full job.  She also does language support and will not be able to do that from the classroom.  We have over 1000Chinese speaking parents.</p>
<p>&#8211;She is for reducing the non-classroom expenses.  She thinks we can replenish supply money in the fall if we get more funds.  She does not want to loose good people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>H.  Social Sciences</p>
<p>— Mat said it is asking too much for reducing department budgets for a 1.0 FTE, not knowing where that position would be.  Not a good idea to deplete the department budget to 0 and preserve 1 FTE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.            ELD</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen discussed the Newcomer Pathway and that we have been working on a very good program. The stakes have changed.  We have had changes of personnel.  Students only get credit for 1 year in English for an ELD class at level 5 or above.  Students are coming in at a lower level now.  60% of those ELL who made the A-G came through our program.</p>
<p>&#8211;Cutting Drama is a big blow to the department.  It is difficult.  Our teachers are trained now to work on writing and speaking and it is different than other schools.</p>
<p>&#8211;About 500 fewer language students who are tested out will not need World Language.</p>
<p>&#8211;Dropping the Arts classes is also a big blow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>J.            English</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said with cuts, any additions do not make sense.  Adding a counselor is not good.</p>
<p>&#8211;Cuts should be equitable and there should be a cut across the board including administrators.</p>
<p>&#8211;Eliminating electives is a topic.  Her department does not have the luxury of offering electives.   24% of students are not college ready in English according to the EAP.  We need to have more support classes in English for our school.  The proposal cuts 5sections from English.  Other departments do not have cuts.  Yesterday she pointed out that English is the only subject that requires 4 years.</p>
<p>&#8211;She would propose eliminating AVID and have those teachers teach English.</p>
<p>&#8211;Cuts in the library would also be cuts in computer lab time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>K.            Ben</p>
<p>&#8211;With computer science bumped up to 4 classes, you must consider that a teacher can only have 3preps.  We might build a program that we can’t support with teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;There is a period that is set-aside for Information Technology—we do need to have this support to keep our wireless system up and running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>L.  Science</p>
<p>&#8211;David said Science supports not adding a counselor.  Not appropriate. The classroom is already receiving a big hit.</p>
<p>&#8211;Yearbook and Journalism should be after school programs.</p>
<p>&#8211;Priority should be to maintain our teaching staff.  If we lose current staff, we lose all our training and that is a huge hit.  We do not want to have the giant turn over like other schools have.</p>
<p>&#8211;ROTC—he has a hard time supporting this program.  Lots of students love it.  Money is a wash.  Our PE teachers do a lot for the school besides teaching classes—like sponsoring clubs, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Supplies—we do need a minimum amount. We should run on bare bones next year.  Maybe parents and teachers can add in a little more.  Saving a position should be a big priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if there were any discretionary funds.  Marcus will think about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consensus Items</p>
<p>&#8211;We should not add an additional counselor.  Marcus asked if this was true for everyone and it is.</p>
<p>&#8211;Move Yearbook and Journalism to an after school program—Marcus said it will be difficult to recruit students.  Michelle said students will want to do this if they want to have a yearbook.</p>
<p>&#8211;With Futurama, if 8 students want to do an activity they will fund it.  Joseph said there is a core of students who want to do the program.</p>
<p>&#8211;The principal supports keeping ROTC.  The rest of the group did not.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said that the cuts should be equitable across the board—6.5%, except for what the district does.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we do need to keep program need in mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said we should address paras, IT tech and secretaries, and if we make cuts there how much of FTE can we fund?</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen talked about the lower salaries of the paras and all the slack they pick up at a lower cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus asked if everyone felt we should cut Classified 6.5 across the board.  The group said No.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben asked if we should cut a secretary.  David said there should be some way to make the cuts equitable.</p>
<p>&#8211;If we approve for Bounmy to stay where he is? Patrick said the contract might be an issue.  Patrick will see if there will be a grievance filed.  He also mentioned grievances in the future such as Health Ed credit for cyber high, and PE credit through Independent Study.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti said absolutely teachers are #1 and running a school involves the cost of doing business.  She said if there is a secretary eliminated, we must think about who is leaving and what skills they have.  Without these supports in place there are problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it a district wide policy there will be no administrative cuts?</p>
<p>Can monies in the school that are in slush funds or discretionary funds in the school to be used for such things as science equipment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;If we leave operating costs at the 2%, we can have 1.0 FTE saved.  Everyone agreed.  Journalism and Yearbook are a .4.  Katie will confirm with Futurama about funding those two activities.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan suggested the administration revise their proposal and bring it back to the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will meet again on Tuesday, March 13<sup>th</sup> at 4<sup>th</sup> period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 12:20pm.</p>

<p align="right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>3/8/12</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 11:20am.  Marcus proposed that we postpone the agenda items and just talk about Budget.  Everyone agreed.  We will have a meeting next week to address the rest of the issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Budget</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie distributed information from past years’ budgets.  We will have a deficit next year of over $650,000.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said the district says we must use 2% for operating expenses.  We have always spent more than 2%.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie distributed a set of possible changes.  The SSC will review this and the principal will make the final decisions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked if there had been discussions with the district as the district has a $55 million reserve.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said we have to submit a budget by March 23 with the allocation the district has given us.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked if there has been discussion with the district about their tremendous reserve.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we need to finish this discussion and then Marcus will go to the district.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie reviewed the document District and School Site Possible Changes document. These are all proposals—room for additions and changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie reviewed what the district will pay for next year and some of the changes we would make.  The cost column shows where the savings would be.</p>
<p>&#8211;Proposal now is to add a counselor, pay for the nurse and grant a stipend as opposed to a prep.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie explained the Non-Classroom and Classroom changes.  The document showed the average class size and any changes that would occur.  She reviewed the courses and indicated where the cuts would be in sections.</p>
<p>&#8211;Top part of the document represents savings of over $70,000 and the bottom portion shows savings of over $581,000.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked about Biotech—Katie said it is listed in Science.  Marcus said he and Stan would meet about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick suggested meeting about this again tomorrow during 4°.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben asked the group if this seems like something that has happened before.  Discussion followed about past years and that last year the fact that Scenario B was bad.  The year before that, Joseph indicated that VPA lost 2 positions.  For next year VPA is losing 15% while the rest of the school is losing 7%.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said that when cuts happen it is often necessary to go to the minimums.  The VPA graduation requirement is 1 course for one year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Graduation requirements are now aligned to the A – G requirements—language, math and science requirements have gone up.  Katie pointed out that the district graduation requirements have changed—not the state’s requirements, but the district’s.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if we have pushed back to the district about the effects.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus brought up the remedial courses and how they do not count for graduation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen asked about ROTC.  Marcus gave the history of this area and talked about the fact that we were on probation for the program as we only had one instructor.  Stan mentioned that ROTC pays for one position if we have it.  The Army is now requiring the ROTC teachers to have a PE credential which will take place in several years.</p>
<p>&#8211;Those students who double up in AP classes bring the school more money.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle brought up the issue of larger class sizes.  She is concerned that the advanced classes are the smaller ones and the under served students are in the larger classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about class sizes with AP and Academy classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said that the English classes for AoHT have 39 students.  AoIT has lots of requests to be in this program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick wanted to discuss the Non-Personnel area.  Katie explained that the 2% would cover school-wide supplies, but departments would get nothing to very little.  David said that would impact all of the life science classes with labs.  English would not be able to order novels.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked Joseph about his budget.  Prop H was discussed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben said he felt the question is will all departments be willing to give up supplies to cover a 1.0 FTE, and if so, what department would have that 1.0 teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed about state adopted textbooks and who pays and what happens when books are lost.  David and Denise told of the textbook inventory checks by the district.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti discussed Math Department finances.  She said they need paper, ink and an Excel program.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle discussed the benefits of having 2 AVID teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked about the rationale of choosing ROTC over 1.0 FTE in PE.  Marcus said the program is popular, a political issue and financially is a wash over having more sections of PE.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked about class sizes in ROTC.  Nancy said we cannot require students to take ROTC.</p>
<p>&#8211;The Army requires 100 students enrolled to continue ROTC.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick mentioned the union contract and what comes up when teachers are reassigned.  Katie asked about the money.  Patrick said we should look into all of this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick congratulated everyone who has worked on this budget.  Katie mentioned that she was sad over this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about with the reduction of students, why are we adding a counselor and cutting teachers?</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said this is a result of continued parent complaints about their students not being able to be seen by a counselor.  This is coming from the students and the parents.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said our current enrollment is 2070.</p>
<p>&#8211;PTSA and Community Meetings were the source of the parent and student complaints about not being able to see counselors.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned some department chairs would resign if the district removed the department head period and offered a stipend; many department chairs might resign.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben said we should rerun this with no AP preps and no Department Head periods.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said with the superintendent’s zone, we could lose 10 teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said many schools run Yearbook and Journalism as after school activities.</p>
<p>&#8211;Journalism is in English; Yearbook is an elective that meets a G requirement.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said Yearbook/Journalism, PE/ROTC, Counselor and supplies are important issues.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie explained the financial issue of funding for the nurse.</p>
<p>&#8211;The Librarian funding would decrease next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray felt Peer Resource is an important program here for Special Ed.  Jessica said the PRC classes are small, so maybe combining them into 2 sections would be financially good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus asked everyone to digest this information and make plans for arguments to the SSC.  We will meet again tomorrow during 4<sup>th</sup> period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 12:15pm.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team/Department Heads Meeting</span></strong></p>
<p align="right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>2/23/12</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Academic Honesty</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus emailed his colleagues and received information from Lincoln and Balboa that he shared with the group.  He asked members to take the information back to their departments for feedback.  He suggested we table this item until the next meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Master Schedule Update</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said we are done registering students on the Google form. She is waiting for the district to be ready for the district registration.  She hopes to be able to have counselors start this process in the next several days.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy will need to get information from this group about placements and she will send out a Google dock for this issue.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle brought up the fact that some teachers feel with some students it is not a good idea for them to register for honors or AP classes.  She asked about the process.  Nancy reviewed the problems we had with this last fall.</p>
<p>&#8211;If a teacher does not give approval for an AP or honors class, the counseling office will honor the teacher’s request.  There is a criteria for honors and AP classes and if the students do not meet the criteria, then they should not take those classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said his department has so many students signing up, that they have to cut students, so they drop the students who do not qualify.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti discussed how the Math department did this last year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus mentioned the superintendent’s policy, but if we have criteria, we can honor that.  We also look at each student on an individual basis.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy will send out information next week.  She would like to have information by March 16<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked which weeks of the first 6-weeks a student could opt out of honors or AP classes.  Nancy said that they need to go through the 7-step process.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said there would not be placement tests for incoming 9<sup>th</sup> graders in May, as the district changes the information over the summer.  This year we will do the placement tests the first few days of school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked about the Feb. 6<sup>th</sup> access to Scheduler.  This always causes a “crunch.”  Nancy said she has to enter the information on Scheduler and it is easier to provide this information to the faculty after it has been entered.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben asked when the new system, Genesis, will be ready.  Nancy said we are supposed to be using it by this time next year.  Nancy said the district has not signed the contract yet.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said the name has been changed to Synergy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the budget is due on March 23<sup>rd</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said that low-level ELL students should not be taking foreign language.  Nancy said that it can be posted on the transcripts that these students have taken foreign language.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise asked when we will know how many students and how many sections?  She mentioned that we will need to order books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Budget Update</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said we would take a $659,000 hit next year.  This is reflecting a drop of 147 students.  We are being budgeted at what we are showing now.  2,074 students for next year.  Ethan asked if there is Scenarios A, B and C, and Katie said no.  She also mentioned that schools across the district are looking at the same drops.  We are getting more SCE and AP monies, down in all other categories.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we would be moving fast with the SSC to make decisions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie asked everyone to hoard supplies, as it will be thinner next year.  She asked everyone to conserve supplies so we can go with a lower operating budget.  The district is mandating that 2% of budgets have to go for operating budget. David would like to know how that compares with our budget this year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked if it would be SSC, Administration, and Leadership Team making the decisions on cuts.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said the district will issue many lay-off notices—it will be blanketed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we will work from our priorities, and then A-G requirements.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we would know by March 23<sup>rd</sup> if we will have layoffs.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said the two priorities are to keep staff and keep lower class sizes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said there are still some protected positions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said last year we spent $292,000—on operating budget—that is 3% of our total budget.  Next year we will have $177,513 for operating budget.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise asked about ordering books for next year and what the deadlines will be.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked if the seniors have to pay for their own graduation.  The seniors now have $17.000 and graduation costs around $13,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Hall Sweep Update</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison reported on the Hall Sweeps.  We have done 3 of them and we will continue to do this once a day for the next week and then on a random basis.  Everyone who is caught gets detention that day.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said this is fantastic.  He mentioned that the security aides have had hours and pay cuts. Please thank the security aides for their hard work with the hall sweeps.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise mentioned the U’s for citizenship grades for tardies, absences, electronics, etc.  She would like to see this enforced as a school policy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph would like to have the administration see the attendance issues the parents complain about from the teachers’ perspectives.</p>
<p>&#8211;Allison said hall passes now have become a hot commodity as students are grabbing them so they can be in the halls.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said we should gather some data—why are students out of class, how many hall passes have been stolen, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise suggested we always ask students why they are out of class in the halls.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen suggested a secret code on the back of the pass.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we will discuss this again in a few weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         NASA Visit Update</p>
<p>&#8211;We now have the name of the astronaut—Captain Daniel W. Bursch.</p>
<p>&#8211;Karen sent out 11 invitations to district personnel.  She has heard from 6 that they will be coming.</p>
<p>&#8211;Karin has 36 confirmed students and would like to have 9 more.  The students will mingle with the district personnel, the NASA visitors, can win prizes, and other benefits.</p>
<p>&#8211;Karin distributed information on the event.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said it would be great to include some of the under served students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the date for the Spring Open House.  Marcus said we would table this item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Professional Courtesy</p>
<p>&#8211;Mathew mentioned an email folks received from one of his department members.  This involved a staff member removing a student from the classroom without acknowledging the teacher, while the class was taking a test.</p>
<p>&#8211;We should greet each other as professionals.  This is great for morale.  Remind out department members to say Hi to other adults.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said it was easier to meet other teachers when faculty meetings were held in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben reminded everyone not to give students your passwords.  Do not let students enter grades, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus thanked Jessica, Wellness, and GSA for the LoveFest.  We also got good press from Ms. Franzen’s class at Crissy Field.  Also, thanks to Sgt. Hardee and Rebecca for the BSU assembly.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle felt that this assembly was invitational, but if it concerns cultural awareness, everyone should go.  It is hard to have mandatory assemblies, but we need to make sure students can go to assemblies concerning their cultures.</p>
<p>&#8211;Some suggested that some boring assemblies be eliminated.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned the two invitational assemblies he puts on.  He discussed the timing and felt that the last week of a grading period is not a good time for an assembly.</p>
<p>&#8211;On March 5<sup>th</sup>, SFPD will put on a presentation on different careers.  They will target students who are on the cusp of truancy.  Students will be given a pass to the presentation.  These are not chronically truant students.   This will address what students can do with just a high school diploma.</p>
<p>&#8211;Requests were made to have this presentation at other than class time.  Allison said she is not able to do the scheduling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leadership Team adjourned at 11:15pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Heads</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Policy for Students Returning Books</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said Allison Wagner is seeing a problem with Cyber High and the materials that are distributed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Some felt we have no policy for returning textbooks.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph felt the real deadline is when they graduate.  He felt that they should be penalized at the end of each school year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick suggested we table this until we get a clear handle on the program.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said her department hands out the cards, if the books are not returned then Connie goes after the students to return the books.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned the English department book room usually gets all returned books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         CPT-ELL</p>
<p>&#8211;This will be the topic for Wednesday’s meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus will distribute information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       School Loop/Department Meeting</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned an email Marcus distributed from a parent.  Much discussion in her department and between department heads followed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked what Marcus’ response to the parent was.  Marcus said he emailed the individual teachers of the students to email the parent.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle would like to see what the teachers thought about this and what kind of support they can expect.</p>
<p>&#8211;This will be tabled until the next meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;David felt this should be brought up at the next faculty meeting, and Marcus could provide his expectations.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti and Michelle thought mixing with other department members would produce helpful conversations about School Loop—strategies, practices, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise mentioned the startling of the short bell rings for the custodians.  Is there another way of alerting the custodians?</p>
<p>&#8211;David saw that the next staff meeting is March 14<sup>th</sup>, and he thought we might move it up to February 29<sup>th</sup>, as the following week is not an early release date.</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat asked for a quick decision on this as he has a guest speaker scheduled.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said he has databases to promote in each department.  Some teachers use these for research projects.  David said these have citable sources.  Patrick will come to department meetings and provide instructions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said there was no tardy report with the bell schedule options—passing time 5 minutes or 7 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked Marcus about Special Ed data.  She mentioned she has heard that some of the regular ed. teachers are not the best match for students coming out of special ed. Teachers are labeled “effective” or “not effective” with working with these students.  She felt some of the language should be changed when asking teachers if they will accept these students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested that no class should have more than the percentage of Special Ed students in the school.  He said this is an equity issue.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said it is an equity issue for students as well.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise suggested para support in the classroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:30am.</p>

<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.            Academic Honesty</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus received a report from Mr. Flisak on cheating.  Marcus asked the group for their input.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben said copying and cheating is the norm.  David Barrios said he gives a “0” on an assignment if he catches a student cheating.</p>
<p>&#8211;Delores  Lee said that kids take pictures of homework and post it on Facebook.  Test are also posted on Facebook.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben found students copying right in front of him with homework for another teacher.  He sends students to the Deans’ Office for suspension when he catches cheating.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy mentioned students attempting to cheat on the CAHSEE yesterday.  Even though the questions are in different order for different versions of the test, Tony said it is possible to match the graphics and copy answers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica wanted to know what message students get from Galileo about cheating—messages on walls about zero tolerance?</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen felt that we need to define cheating.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said her teachers cover in the beginning of the year what is and what is not cheating.  Different teachers have different policies, but they state them and the consequences in their syllabus.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph felt it is hard to start a new policy now, but the group disagreed.</p>
<p>&#8211;David talked about an incident last year where the student who was receiving the department award was caught cheating.  It was a difficult situation.  He felt that no student thinks cheating is OK, but that it is easy to get away with.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen told of a similar incident.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said cheating is not acceptable at any time of the year.  He spreads the students out and does as much as he can to make sure they do not cheat.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle felt teachers are changing the way they are assessing students, especially at the college level.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony mentioned, “When does collaborating become cheating?”</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben felt we have to deal with the issue of students wanting to get points for good grades.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus will call other principals to see what is happening at other schools and we will continue the discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph talked about artists and musicians modeling their work after their predecessors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.            Bell Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we are still working on the spreadsheet for the student survey.  We are looking at A and B and the difference is the amount of passing period minutes.  Tony is still working on the student schedules.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked if there are more students late with a 5-minute passing period, versus a 7-minute passing period. Concrete data will be good.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony talked about information on School Loop about tardies—biggest amount was for first period and then right after lunch.</p>
<p>&#8211;Suggestion was made to compare 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> period tardies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.            School Loop</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed a packet on School Loop.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he gets lots of interest from the parents about School Loop, particularly the 9th and 10<sup>th</sup> grade parents, as they are used to it from middle school.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus told of his experience at the training for School Loop.  The trainer has a student at Galileo and she was disappointed she only hears from one of her son’s teacher on School Loop.</p>
<p>&#8211;66% of our teachers completed the survey on School Loop.  Most of those felt comfortable using School Loop.  Tony went through questions on the survey and some of the results.</p>
<p>&#8211;Needing training and lack of time were the main reasons teachers were not using School Loop.  The training is from 4-6pm, after the working day.</p>
<p>&#8211;25% of parents are registered to use School Loop.  Ray mentioned that we have a minority using School Loop.  Tony said at his former school 90% of the parents were using it and all the teachers were.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben felt that we need to tell parents what is going on with their kids.  Patrick felt we have high school students.  The parent is not holding their hand all the time, but we do need to check on how the students are doing.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed about using School Loop, time it takes to post grades, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph told of his experiences and he said it is a good communication tool with the students who use it more often than the parents. Joseph felt the trainings should be done in the common planning time, not after school.  4-6pm is his time and there are other activities that he needs to do.  We are professionals and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>&#8211;The district is using our building for a district-wide School Loop training, and that is why it is scheduled from 4-6pm.</p>
<p>&#8211;David suggested we do in-house training.  Many teachers do not know how to do many of the items on School Loop.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan says School Loop takes time.  He would like the district to do a survey of what times during the day/evening/night the data is input.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we will use School Loop next year in some way.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said that School Loop is a contract issue.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said if we have School Loop access at school, the principal can put it in the Principal’s Expectations.</p>
<p>&#8211;David Barrios brought up the fact that those teachers not contacting parents by School Loop are contacting parents in other ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.            February 14<sup>th</sup> Wellness &amp; GSA Event</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica talked about this event.  This concerns sexual health and teen relationships.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica said she had 2 pregnant students in her office this morning.  This happens often.</p>
<p>&#8211;She talked about students in abusive relationships.</p>
<p>&#8211;She talked about students working on “coming out” to their parents.</p>
<p>&#8211;This event will be highlighted on the district website next week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Our ELL students do not know where to get reproductive information.</p>
<p>&#8211;There will be 42 workshops this year. She asked the members of this group to sign up.</p>
<p>&#8211;Some teachers are giving students extra credit for the noon-time activities.  Please encourage your teachers to participate.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said some of his students asked him to officiate at their wedding at the event.  Jessica told him to see Jackie Peters.  She told of the educational games by the marriage booths.</p>
<p>&#8211;Price to get married is 50 cents.  Proceeds go to GSA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.            Policy for Food Sales</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat asked what the school policy is. Marcus said there should not be any food sales on campus.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica said any candy sales for students are against district policy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Food Sales to teachers are OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.            Rise in Hall Walking</p>
<p>&#8211;We are being vigilant to curb this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII.            CAHSEE</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said the auditorium was chaos and not well thought out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Head</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus gave kudos to Ray for his efforts to give Special Ed. students the regular tests.</p>
<p>&#8211;CST—California Standards Test—what everyone takes.  CMA is a modified assessment.  It is almost as difficult as the CST.  CMA does not count towards the school’s API.</p>
<p>&#8211;CAPA is for the severely impaired students.</p>
<p>&#8211;State goal is to have no more than 3% of students taking the CMA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.            Testing Update</p>
<p>&#8211;City College Placement Exam is February 24<sup>th</sup> for seniors going to City College.  It will be at Galileo from approximately 8am-noon.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said last year CCSF gave the SFUSD priority for 2 classes they had to take.  This year our students attending CCSF have to have at least 3 classes that will transfer to a 4 year university.</p>
<p>&#8211;The test will be given in the library.  Students sign up for the test.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray would like his students to take the test at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8211;CAHSEE—this past one was our census test and counts for the API score.  On both dates we tested 98% of the students we were supposed to test.  We needed to test at least 95%.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said it was a little bit chaotic for those students who did not have a place to go when their classrooms were being used.  This is a whole school effort.  She asked for cooperation from all staff and teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise mentioned miscommunication on the second day.  The time of 10:30am was confusing and some students did not finish by that time.  Denise asked about students who did not report to her class until after 11am.  Discussion followed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested we plan a fun activity for those students who finish the test by 10:30am.  Kathleen said that some kids might rush through the test to go out and play.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the auditorium and how it was used.  Joseph turned the house lights up, as he felt it was too dark inside.</p>
<p>&#8211;Those two specific days are the only days we can do the CAHSEE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;9<sup>th</sup> Grade Practice CAHSEE</p>
<p>&#8211;This year we can decide if we want to give it.  Ray and Kathleen both said, “No.”</p>
<p>&#8211;Will having the test improve our passing rate?  Ray said there are no stakes.  Decision made not to give it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.            Registration</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said they should finish on time by Feb. 17<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;We can enter the information in Scheduler right after that, by the beginning of March.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.            Academic Literacy Discussion Check-in</p>
<p>&#8211;Academic Literacy is a school priority.  First we have to define academic literacy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat said his department included reading, writing, academic norms—bring materials to class, ask for help, etc.  Know how to act in academic environment.</p>
<p>&#8211;Science focused on the standards. Specifics come from the standards.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said her department came up with definitions—and ability to navigate all of their classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said her department mostly talked about AP classes and what is expected of these students.  High literacy is one of the issues.  They do SSR in the target language.</p>
<p>Students who are ELD in their classes do very well.  They learn from the ground up.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned his department came up with 40 words that would apply to all his classes and were what the students should know by graduation.  He also liked the academic norms—bring a pencil.</p>
<p>&#8211;Standard Literacy in an Academic School, then Department literacy—Tony mentioned this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Academic Literacy means different things to different people.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said in their department said they talked about navigating through a textbook, etc. He mentioned the parts of a textbook.  These things need to be taught.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony will put all this information together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.            Common Formative Assessments &amp; Data Director</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus gave some background information on the usefulness of this information.</p>
<p>&#8211;The goal is for every course to have a common assessment and have a common final exam.</p>
<p>&#8211;This goal is for next fall.</p>
<p>&#8211;One a piece of data is entered for a student, it is linked to the content standards and teachers can watch their students over time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Any assessment teachers are now doing can be digitized.  This requires using rubrics.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said the big task is to get together with the teachers to work this out.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony said it will take time to get this all set up.  What am I teaching, how am I teaching, and do I have a good collaborative relationship with other teachers who are teaching the same course?</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed.</p>
<p>&#8211;David mentioned that much has been going on this year with data, etc., and there has not been much time to talk about curriculum.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise is not sure how to explain this to her colleagues.  She asked for Tony to come and help her.  She also mentioned Chinese literacy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle talked about Common Planning Time.  In the past one hour was Cluster Meetings, and one hour was Department Time.  She said this year they do not have the time to do this.  Marcus said those discussions will happen once we get the CLA and Data Director in place.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus told about his experience at Thurgood Marshall.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony said he is hearing that teachers want to have more planning time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said we need more staff development.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said everyone in the district supports CLA, but Data Director is not mandatory now.  We need to develop the CLAs first and then get to Data Director.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11;50AM.</p>
