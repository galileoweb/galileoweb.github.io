<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team/Department Heads Meeting</span></strong></p>
<p align="right"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>4/26/12</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Student and Teacher Voices</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph shared conversations with students about the STAR tests.  Joseph mentioned that there are 5 different versions of the test and the questions are in different order on each of the versions.  He talked about how excited these students were about solving the math problems on the test, during their lunch hour.</p>
<p>&#8211;He talked about the RIP tombstones they made for the band program being cut.  One student asked him about the cuts.  One student said her brother was going be a Gal student next year and band is the only thing he is good at.  He told of other students who were upset about the end of the band.</p>
<p>&#8211;Then Joseph read the speech that he read to the parents and students in the auditorium at the Open House last night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Tonight, we are witnessing the last performance of the Band on this stage.</p>
<p>Every other spring concert that I have helped produce in my 18 years at Galileo has been a time of celebration. This year’s concert is different.  This is a time for mourning and sadness.  87 years ago, the Galileo Band and Galileo Piano program was born.  For 87 years, the music program has contributed to the culture and fabric of Galileo.</p>
<p>We will never hear the fight song played at Song and Yell.</p>
<p>Future graduating seniors will not be called to the stage to receive their diplomas with the clarion call of the trumpets playing the opening strains of “Pomp and Circumstance.”</p>
<p>Graduating seniors will not be able to sing the Galileo Hymn with the Band.</p>
<p>Beginning piano students will no longer be able to touch the genius of great composers like Bach, Beethoven and Mozart.</p>
<p>Incoming 9<sup>th</sup> grade students will not be able to become a part of this tradition that has been in existence since 1925!</p>
<p>Tonight, the work of a long line of dedicated, hard working music teachers comes to a crashing halt.</p>
<p>There is a chance that this may not come to pass.  Every other time that the Arts have faced a catastrophic demise, money has been found.  Budgets have been restored.  The needs and desires of students have been realized.</p>
<p>We are here to celebrate the band’s long and powerful life.  Thank you to all musicians, parents, teachers, and administrators who have helped support music at Galileo.</p>
<p>The world will little note, nor long remember what I say tonight, but it can never forget the music that has been made here. Our job is to be dedicated to the unfinished work that they who performed here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is for us to be dedicated to the great task remaining before us—to preserve the long tradition of music at Galileo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked if the SSC has discussed priorities for restoring programs.  Marcus said this would happen at their next meeting.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick thanked Joseph for sharing his thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said that everyone needs to know about items such as this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus is in conversation with Rob Daniels about this and restoring the position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Academic Honesty</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Open House Feedback</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat said some in his department question the need for all teachers to be present.</p>
<p>&#8211;He did mention that a big wave of students and parents came by to see their display</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he agreed, but he did not know how to say who should be here and who should be excused.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise thought about teachers who travel far by public transportation or have young children.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti recalled a year in the past where only several teachers from each department were asked to be present.</p>
<p>&#8211;David suggested doing it as a department choice.  He also mentioned that this used to be more oriented to our current students, but it has become more of an 8<sup>th</sup> grade event.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph felt that the tour groups should be spaced farther apart.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph also advocated for a return to having the Fall Open House moved to week 10 so we can distribute report cards to parents—that brought many more parents to the event.  He also mentioned that some parents have students in more than 1 school and they cannot attend all the events when they are all in the same week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica shared her thoughts about the event.  She did not get as many parents as she was prepared for.  She said the feeling was chaotic and felt it did not showcase the amazing programs at Galileo.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said they tell the parents who are registering their students about the Open House.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick mentioned that if Department Chairs were the ones required to attend, they might not be available for a CPT if they are given comp time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said you cannot use where people live or how many children they have as a means of excusing teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;David felt it is better when the parents are free flowing and not in groups.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica volunteered to help see how we can change this event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Final Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;It is now posted on the Web Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         2012/2013 Bell Schedule</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David wanted to discuss the homerooms and passing times.</p>
<p>&#8211;Some teachers want homeroom every week.</p>
<p>&#8211;He also said there should be discussion on the passing periods.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy asked Patrick if there was a vote last year on the bell schedule.  Patrick said it was on the CPT—1 day or 2 for early release, which affects the bus schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked if Patrick could have the UBC put out a survey.  Patrick said the UBC would review the survey.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said her teachers felt the teachers know the students better for testing when we have a weekly homeroom.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben said for scheduling purposes it seems to be better to have consistency and have the homeroom weekly.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked Patrick to do another survey.  Patrick said the UBC will work on contractual issues.  He also said the UBC is not a paid position.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti thought the UBC was involved in creating this year’s schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben said we have a Leadership Team, a UBC and an SSC and no one wants to take the lead on this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked how many questions should be on the survey.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked for feedback.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said his department did not want to have homeroom only once a month.  Denise said her department felt the same.</p>
<p>&#8211;Bettie recalled for the group the days of Galileo being an II/USP school with low-test scores.  The Homeroom was reinstated then so that teachers could build relationships with their students which would help students want to do better on the tests.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked Stan to do a survey with 2 questions—Weekly Homeroom or not?  5 or 7 minute passing period?</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph is in favor or the weekly homeroom and a 7-minute passing period as the bathrooms are really crowded and 5 minutes is not long enough.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested we also survey the teachers about the length of SSR.  He also said that we need to be flexible.  Galileo is an organic being and we need to revisit the ground rules.</p>
<p>&#8211;David offered some insight into why we are having this discussion now.  He thought we did not make a decision on the homerooms and the passing periods.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus is happy with what makes the teachers and students happy.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise suggested homeroom on one of the block days.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked if the survey should be on email or hard copy.  Joseph said he would help do a Google doc.  Joseph said it could be done during CPT next week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we would have to have plans for things to do during homeroom.</p>
<p>&#8211;Bettie talked about the many bell schedules that need to be programmed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Build On</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus introduced Chad Zibelman from Build On.</p>
<p>&#8211;Chad said they have been here since 2008, they are a national organization and their focus is to enhance education and empower youth.  This is worldwide.  This year they are an after school program; in previous years they were a lunchtime program.</p>
<p>&#8211;He mentioned that a Galileo student in this program was on the national news last week. One focus is community service.</p>
<p>&#8211;There are two full time employees in the schools to run the program.</p>
<p>&#8211;Chad would like to have a space on campus.  He would like to look at partnering with an academy or program at Galileo.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise asked if he has talked with Summerfund.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked if Build On was going to work with our groups who already do Community Service.  Chad said they would like to get other students involved as well.</p>
<p>&#8211;Chad said they are now under the umbrella of Futurama.  They are at Leadership now and they will start full time in the fall.  The organization builds schools in foreign countries and gives the students the opportunity to travel abroad and help build schools in foreign countries.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph expressed his feelings on how positive this type of work is.  He mentioned Christmas in April from the past.  He is in favor of building community service here at Galileo.</p>
<p>&#8211;Karin said she has parents who want activities for their children during the summer. She expressed her concerns to keep this open and not partner with a pathway, as that limits the student participation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII.      Master Schedule</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said they continue to work on the schedule.  This year there is more data from the district than they have ever had before.  Beginning on May 13 we will get another 100 9<sup>th</sup> graders.  We have 430 now committed to Galileo—530 were admitted.  We will get more money.  We may be facing some changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said they might have to change their department schedules, as they did not get another room.  If you have any ideas on rooms, please let David know.  He will have to change the singleton/doubleton situation.  Nancy and David will work on this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said her last day is tomorrow.  Things will continue to be influx.  Nancy is training Lauren and Nancy will keep in touch with Lauren.  Marcus and Tony have done the master schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Many items will affect the Master Schedule and there will be changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise discussed conversations with parents about 9<sup>th</sup> graders taking world languages.  Nancy said we do not have the capacity to offer world languages to 9<sup>th</sup> graders.  They do have to take the College and Career course during 9<sup>th</sup> grade.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti discussed the transition with her retiring and Doug Page taking over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph wanted to discuss the extra days for department heads.  This year we did 2 days before school and 3 days after school.  She mentioned how Vicki handled this in the past.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said since we will have Summer School at Galileo, then department heads could come in during summer school to work on the schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said they would talk about this in their administrative meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said that there was talk of Nancy moving to C &amp; I.  At this point that won’t happen and the new position is for C &amp; I.  Round 2 of interviews will be tomorrow.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise expressed her hope that we get someone who knows about high school curriculum.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle talked about the CPT and how much of it has not been productive.  She mentioned that we have not had cluster meetings.  She would like to see more of this in the CPT schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray misses the 2-hour meetings.  He said an hour is not long enough to get major tasks done.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said it is important for teachers to share their best practice with their colleagues.  He thought these meetings should be interdepartmental.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti felt that we need to know ahead of time when meetings are scheduled—weeks ahead of time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti suggested doing a survey or room need, ratios.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned rumors in the district about eliminating department head positions and AP preps.  Then we will need more rooms.</p>
<p>&#8211;David felt we should minimize teachers having to move during the school day.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti will look at the ratios. Michelle and David will help her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked everyone to thank Richard McDowell for his hard work on winning a 2-year grant worth $50,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Department Head Agenda</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.  Balanced Score Card Review</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed some current information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Item tabled until next meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Professional Development Day Feedback</p>
<p>&#8211;His department appreciated the flexibility of the day and that teachers could catch up as being very valuable.</p>
<p>&#8211;Others agreed.  Many said it was the best PD day they’ve ever had.  They had time to get things accomplished.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said the best PD days are those that are on-site.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti said her department really enjoyed the flexibility.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus thanked everyone for the feedback.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray learned that IEP meetings are not optional and IEP teachers and administrators must attend the meeting from beginning to end unless a box is check on the form that they will only attend part of the time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said it is difficult when teachers have to attend an IEP on their prep time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the district is going to work on making IEPs more streamlined.</p>
<p>&#8211;It is an administrator’s duty to find coverage for teachers who have to attend an IEP during their class time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said that IEPs should never take more than an hour.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said all of his teachers will check the box saying “Part of” for teachers and administrators attending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the agenda for the department heads 2 days prior to start of school.  The department heads need time outside of meetings to get work done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked for input for the survey for homerooms and passing times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 12:25pm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:10am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          ELL IOC Report</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus introduced Jen Fong who will give us the ELL  IOC report.  She discussed the unannounced visit earlier this semester, March 19, 2012.  She mentioned the Lau case and said that the courts keep finding us out of compliance.  This is the Internal Oversight Committee to make sure we are serving the ELL students.  This group is composed partly of assistant superintendents.</p>
<p>&#8211;She distributed information and explained its development.  The feedback from the visit should produce reflection and then growth.</p>
<p>&#8211;She mentioned that this is the 6<sup>th</sup> report in the district this year.  In the past there has not been a lot of support for the ELL students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan asked for the definition of a Language Objective.  Jen used the terms compare and contrast.  She mentioned that they would be happy to do some professional development in this area.  She used the term graphic organizers.  She wants the students to have academic English.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;She came for the review with her team and others, totaling 12 individuals.  They visited as many places as they could.  They talked to non-classroom staff and students.  They still need to talk to the parents.</p>
<p>&#8211;It was clear that everyone was aware of the ELL students.  Newcomers have 0-1 year in US schools.  Developing ELs have 2-4 years in US schools.  Long Term ELs have 5+ years.</p>
<p>&#8211;In classes where there were very few ELs, they did not see as much strategies for these students as in classes where there were many Els.  She said it is mandated that teachers use SADIE strategies and that is why all teachers are mandated to have a CLAD.  Student to student activities and graphic organizers are some of the things they were looking for.  Do we see visuals?</p>
<p>In lecture classes, the ELs have a harder time absorbing the material.  They like to see a variety of strategies that help students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Please move ELD .7-.8 to regular English so that they will be eligible for UC entrance.  She sees that happening at Galileo.  We do not want to mix Newcomers with Long Term ELs, even if they have the same CELT scores.  The Long Term ELs do not take the CELT seriously. Now that more ELs are being included in the mainstream, we need to use strategies to reach them.  She addressed the difference in the Long Term ELs’ speaking and writing skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked if separation of the ELs and the ELAs in mainstream classes is important.  Jen discussed the differences between Long Term ELs and other students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said many folks are not clear on the difference between .6 and .8 classes.  She asked for more PD in this area.  Jen said they are eager to do this.</p>
<p>&#8211;July 23-27, 2012 are dates for training over the summer.  Those who attend will follow up when they return to the site.  There is a $2,000 stipend for doing this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jen said they would come to the site and design training that would work here.  She said you will see immediate results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked if the district will make it easier to identify the different students.</p>
<p>She said Data Director does it now.  She hopes it will be on SIS shortly.</p>
<p>&#8211;.6 in English means something different than in Math, Science and Social Studies.</p>
<p>&#8211;Jen encouraged everyone to attend some of the trainings.  She also encouraged everyone to ask for help with strategies.</p>
<p>&#8211;She said that we could get picked again next year for the IOC visit and she hopes they would see growth at that time.</p>
<p>&#8211;She encouraged increasing student-to-student interaction.  This is more engaging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed information on the Balanced Score Card.  Please look at the ELL section and we will discuss it next meeting.  Do we want to do these activities by department or school-wide?</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus also distributed some information from the last WASC review to remind and refresh our thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8211;He said our EL students and our Newcomer students are extremely motivated to be successful.  We are doing good things at Galileo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben asked if we did well in this review and will we come under additional scrutiny. Marcus said there are areas for improvement, but we are doing a lot of things well.  He spoke about using more visuals next year to help our EL students.  Kathleen mentioned they are making posters to use the academic language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned concerns with the re-designation of students that can cause elimination of some skill sets. Kathleen touched on the criteria students need to move to the next level.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said there should be this information can be given to al faculty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         CAHSEE Results</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony passed out the results and gave credit to Jonathan Ring for creating the document.  He explained the document and highlighted the gains.  He felt the overall numbers were great.  Special Ed students are included in this report.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben commented on the zip code break down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said CSU is going to start using the CST tests for Math and English placement, instead of the EAP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Common Formative Assessments</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;April 23<sup>rd</sup> is a PD day and this is the entire agenda.  We want to see one each semester.</p>
<p>&#8211;Teachers can attend other PDs off site, but the CFAs must be completed prior to 4/23.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy brought up lunch and the fact that many wanted to go off campus for lunch.  Lunch is on your own.</p>
<p>&#8211;There will be a short faculty meeting in the morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Budget</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we submitted a budget initially by balancing the budget by not using the mandated 2% for operating costs.  We wanted to use the projected AP money for that.  It was turned down.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus, Karin and, Katie worked on a revision.  They used categorical funds for the counselors.  We have an ELD retirement, so we did not fill that position.  If get an influx of Newcomers we will have to ask for more funds for these students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy gave department heads the sections based on what we have now.  Things change over the summer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked how many 9<sup>th</sup> graders were assigned here and how many have signed up?  As of yesterday there were 130 who have not committed to Galileo.  520-550 were assigned.  TAs phoned the homes and some parents did not realize they had to come in for enrollment.  Many Latinos did not realize they had to come to the school to accept.  Only 7 of the 130 said they were going to go to another school.  Karin Lau will call those families.</p>
<p>&#8211;Round 2 for enrollment will start soon.  It will begin on May 13<sup>th</sup>.  Round 3 will be in the summer time.  Nancy said we should have more students that we expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Master Schedule—singleton/doubleton meeting tomorrow 4° in 102.  There will be another meeting on Thursday of the STAR testing week if we do not finish.  Nancy asked everyone to check the Google Doc and enter the singletons and doubletons.</p>
<p>&#8211;Try to have one class of each grade level in every period.  Let Marcus and Nancy know if there are too many 1<sup>st</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> period preps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus mentioned student placement.  ELL students are supposed to start and end the day with those support classes.  This is a WASC recommendation.  Nancy said the ELD classes are on the even periods and the labs are on the odd periods.  Kathleen said they tried to have the students in the ELD community at the beginning and the end of the day.  He encouraged each department to review the WASC and the Balanced Score Card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;FRISCO Day is tomorrow.  There are students turning in last minute field trip slips.  The district is providing more busses.  Those students who are not going need to show up for classes.  Anyone who does not come to school or to FRISCO Day will not be allowed to go to Prom.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben discussed the severe consequence for this particular day if a student cuts versus any other day.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said parents might have a valid argument against this punishment.  He mentioned recent articles in the <span style="text-decoration: underline">SF Chronicle</span> that are disturbing about CTS at Mission and O’Connell.</p>
<p>&#8211;Discussion followed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph felt the day was poorly scheduled—on the last day of the grading period.  He felt the administration should protest this schedule and say it does not work for our teachers.  Marcus said there was no opportunity to say this.  Marcus felt that some teachers felt they were done with grading by the last day of the grading period.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said it is earlier this year and the district wants to wait until students get accepted to college.  Some teachers felt it was too close to AP testing.  Suggestion was made to do it during CST time.  Chaperones then become a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Bettie distributed the Draft of the April 25<sup>th</sup> Open House for Karin Lau.  Marcus said there was a suggestion to offer extra credit if families come.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said the kids go from room to room on the Scavenger Hunt and do not ask any questions about programs, etc.  Teachers and parents felt it was a waste of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the parents felt the number of questions should be limited—students can pick the questions they are interested in.  Marcus will send an email to everyone with what the parents suggested.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy suggested parents and students should visit departments.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said it should be student run, which would be more interesting to the in-coming students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise asked if all teachers were required to attend.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray said some parents try to monopolize the teachers.  This is not a time for teacher conferences.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben felt we should have a clear statement of purpose.  Then we can figure out the activities.</p>
<p>&#8211;David felt we should be showcasing the first floor and have that open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said Wednesday, April 18<sup>th</sup> at 2:15pm there will be a School Loop Training in 102 for submitting grades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:40am.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 10:05am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Budget</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie distributed the most current budget sheet.  This consists of input from this group and the SSC.</p>
<p>&#8211;The district is adding to the librarian position and the nurse.  We are cutting .5 para position and .2 clerical.  We are moving .4 from the TSA to ELD.  We are cutting .6 from AVID and moving it to English.  English we are cutting .8, offset by .6 AVID and .2 Journalism. College Career/Health—cut .4, move .2 to Social Studies and only 9<sup>th</sup> graders.  PE is cut 1.4., offset by .4 TSA. We are cutting IT prep.  We are cutting .4 from ELD. Math—no change.  Peer Resource no change. Science—additional sections, no ASB prep, $2K stipend, additional students.  Social Studies add .2 from CC/Health.  VAPA—cut.4 fewer students (A-G). World Language&#8211;no change.  Yearbook/Journalism combined class.</p>
<p>&#8211;We will be keeping drama.</p>
<p>&#8211;3.6 % cut in Certificated classroom positions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie discussed operating costs.  We have a total operating budget of $142,293.00 for the coming year.  Last year we had $263,105 from the WSF.</p>
<p>&#8211;We are getting a 6.9% cut, but only a 3.6 certificated classroom cut.  We have an 8.8% cut in classified positions.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked about PE credit for sports.  Next year students will not get credit.  He also asked about the 138 students that have to take PE because they did not pass the content standards.  Marcus mentioned the administration has discussed having an after school program for these students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben mentioned that some of these students were involved in academies and other programs and relied on sports credit for PE to complete their requirements.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we are out of compliance with this and we are not supposed to do this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan has to test these students and if they do not pass, then they have to take PE.</p>
<p>&#8211;Those certificated cuts—teachers are entitled to a 1.0 position in the district.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked about ROTC.  There will be 1 position, and we pay .5.  If outside funding happens, then we may have 2 positions.  Leo is working on his PE credential.  We are planning for 150 students in ROTC.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan asked about enrollment numbers for ROTC in all grades.  He asked if students are arbitrarily placed in ROTC and then they can opt out.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said a lot of these numbers will change in the fall.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan talked about the fact that periods 5 and 6 are heavy in PE and the morning classes are lighter.  We need to balance the classes.  1<sup>st</sup> period and 6th period classes have the most students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick questioned cutting .2 from social studies and cutting 1 .4 from PE.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the PE classes are small.  Ethan said the class size should be 37.  Marcus said 37 is an average number for class sizes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said there were cuts all over the place.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said the members of the SSC refused last night to sign off on the budget.  It was submitted and will have a letter stating objections to being cut this year.  Out of 17 high schools in SF, our funding is 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said the letter is currently being drafted and this group will get a copy of it.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said this is not an easy process and he thanked everyone for their input and participation.  He thanked Katie for her hard work.  Jonathan Ring and Mele did an excellent job as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Vending Machines</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie has been approached by a company to put in vending machines at Galileo stocked with healthy foods.  Wallenberg, Mission and Gateway have them.</p>
<p>&#8211;We would get money for them—50-50.</p>
<p>&#8211;We can decide where the vending machines are placed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Last time we had them they were located in ROTC and kids were cutting classes and hanging out there.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph mentioned the history of having a Coke machine in the Band Room and all the problems that came with it.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray mentioned that vending machines are quicker than leaving campus.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus felt that if we do it, we should do it ourselves and keep all the money.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben felt the students should initiate the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Student Activity Dates</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie emailed this to everyone and she got some appreciation.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said April 13<sup>th</sup> is Frisco Day for Seniors re: college.</p>
<p>&#8211;ASB assembly will be Thursday 4/12.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested having a regular 1-6 schedule and having a double 4<sup>th</sup> or double 6<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle suggested the assembly on Monday prior to STAR testing.  STAR testing always starts on a Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie asked if we could do the voting during the periods in the afternoon after the morning STAR tests.  Everyone agreed.</p>
<p>&#8211;Assembly is Monday April 16<sup>th</sup> for ASB elections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Open House</p>
<p>&#8211;Counseling Office has sent information out to prospective students saying it is April 25<sup>th</sup>.  Incoming 9<sup>th</sup> graders have been given this date.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph wanted to have it the same evening as the Spring Concert.</p>
<p>&#8211;Registration for incoming 9<sup>th</sup> graders was arbitrarily moved up a week.  Nancy said the notice from the district was late.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph would like to coordinate these two events in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Staff Appreciation</p>
<p>&#8211;Thursday, May 3<sup>rd</sup> is the date Gayline is proposing.  It will be the Faculty Meeting time—switched from Wednesday to Thursday.  Wednesday will be for department meetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Master Schedule Update</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy told the group that the counselors are now inputting the information that the teachers have sent.  We should be able to figure out how many sections for each course the week after Spring Break.  They are trying to do some comparison data.</p>
<p>&#8211;She mentioned that there will be some blanks in student schedules in the beginning—mostly to show the district we need a lot of help.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we will not double up on science classes to see what we are working with and to show the district the bare bones schedules.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said some of the schedules for juniors and seniors would only have 4 classes.  Joseph asked how they could graduate if they could not have a full schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;This is a long process and we will see what the bare bones looks like.  Hopefully the district will release more funds and we can expand.</p>
<p>&#8211;9<sup>th</sup> graders for the fall are registering now until April 13<sup>th</sup>.  The district has put in 532 9<sup>th</sup> graders.  That means more money for us as originally we were projected at 450 students.  The counseling office will call those who have not come to register.  They will also do some outreach.  That would mean $4,279.00 per student.  That would mean over $400,000 more money.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked about the demographics.  Tony said 49% Chinese, 25% Latino and all other ethnicities were not higher than 10%.</p>
<p>&#8211;The real $$ amount comes after the 10 day count.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said there are also upper class students who do not return in the fall.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about the singleton/doubleton meeting—April 12<sup>th</sup> is the target date.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren will take over Nancy’s position in the Counseling Office while Nancy is on maternity leave and Tony will be helping with the Master Schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII.      Copy Machines in 307</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise talked of an experience she had several weeks ago and she talked about a project where someone copied a book—23 originals, 55 copies.</p>
<p>&#8211;Please remind your department members to use the Riso for large volumes.</p>
<p>&#8211;The Xerox machine in 307 is broken.</p>
<p>&#8211;We are trying to keep students out of copy machines.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked about codes for each person.  Joseph mentioned that teachers would give their codes to their students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Large printing jobs can be sent to the district office now, but that won’t happen next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti mentioned in the past each department head talked to the teachers in their department who make lots of copies.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ben suggested that unattended big jobs be seized and brought to the main office for pick-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VIII.     School Safety Concerns</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise mentioned that we have no School Crossing Signs by our school.  There</p>
<p>Should be on every corner.  We will put in a work order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IX.        Star Testing Procedures</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti wanted to make sure that everybody knows what they are to do as far as picking up, dropping off, etc.  All ducks should be in a row.  Vicki did it for the last 15 years.  She would like to see everything spelled out way ahead of time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony did the STAR testing for 2 years at Aptos.  The first faculty meeting after Spring Break we will go over the procedures.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony will try to replicate as much as possible what has been done in the past.</p>
<p>&#8211;Our usual substitutes will be on hand to help.</p>
<p>&#8211;We will use Room 253 for the headquarters.</p>
<p>&#8211;The group asked for the bell schedule for STAR test.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise brought up the fact that teachers who are assigned as support should be ready to relive the regular teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti asked to be somewhat free so she can handle the problems with Math department encounters during the testing.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said it is important for teachers to read the directions, as they are different every year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marti suggested an information session just prior to the STAR testing so everyone has all the information.</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise said it is important to follow the script that comes with the test.</p>
<p>&#8211;Karin talked about the Chinese Immersion schedule.</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat suggested the relief schedule be kept within the department.</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie suggested that teachers be assigned as a team to give the test and do a 50-50 job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IX.        Common Formative Assessments</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he hoped everyone was almost done with this. April 23<sup>rd</sup> is the target date.  This will be department time.</p>
<p>&#8211;Tony said the most recent CLA’s are now in Data Director.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ray talked about the problem when the pre-slugged answer sheets are not ready for the students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:30am.</p>

<p><strong>A note from Principal Blacksher:</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The minutes below reflect our leadership team&#8217;s grappling with extraordinary budgetary challenges. All of us &#8211; administrators and education staff &#8211; are acting with transparency and collaboration. At times, conversations can become difficult. Difficult conversations are sometimes necessary and sometimes useful. However, reported only through meeting minutes, misinterpretations and misrepresentations can occur. I urge you to read carefully, react with patience and understanding, and ask for clarification of anything reported in our minutes. We are all in this together. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 11:20am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nancy reminded the group to turn in spreadsheets by Thursday on where the students chose to go to classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said he has a separate spreadsheet for each teacher.  Can he put each teacher on a separate sheet?  Nancy said take more time and put them all on one sheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></strong></p>
<p>I.          Budget</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus distributed a new budget sheet.  They took supplies away and put in another FTE.  The actual costs are not on the sheet.  The average teacher salary went down and it reflected on this sheet.  We can add back a librarian, no change, the paras, TSA,  and they took out the counselor.</p>
<p>&#8211;Avid is cut from 8-5 sections, ELD cut of 1, English cut  2 with one going back in, so a cut of 1, PE, cut of 2, VAPA,</p>
<p>World Language cut .6.  ROTC stays at a .5.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked how the Army will do with 1 ROTC instructor.  Marcus said unless the SSC thinks otherwise, we will do this and probably go back on probation with only 1 instructor.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if this a proposal or talking points.  Marcus said these are talking points.  The budget is due March 23<sup>rd</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A.         English</p>
<p>&#8211;Michele mentioned the 24% of seniors ready for college.  She mentioned the API scores—37% comes from English.  She asked why we would cut this important department.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said one of our focuses is on literacy and restoring the librarian meets this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned the larger class sizes will have an impact on learning and the scores.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said we have many more electives than other high schools.  He discussed the scores.  He mentioned the size of the Math department and the fact that the lower level class sizes are kept small.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Katie said Science has an average class size that is higher than both English and Math.</p>
<p>&#8211;Many of the elective Math classes bring us money with the AP classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said Science has larger class sizes as students are allowed to double up and this affects the statistics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marti said pre-calculus is being offered throughout the district.  Doubling up is not allowed in Math classes for next year. This affects about 40 students. Marti said there are students that need a 4<sup>th</sup> year Math class.</p>
<p>&#8211;David said many of our kids are college bound and it is more challenging today to get into college.  Many students come here for what we have to offer to make a difference in special courses we offer.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if we could handle the number of students who need Health?  We offer it in 9<sup>th</sup> now, but some 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup>, next year 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> will need to take it.  The 12<sup>th</sup> graders will have to take it on cyber high.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked about clerical staffing.  He asked this of Katie.  She said that given Lauren’s remarks at the last meeting this was not considered.  Cutting an hour per clerical position would be a larger reduction than 6.5%.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked if we could continue to look at this in a dollar amount and then decide how much to reduce clerical and IT support personnel.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked about discretionary funds and Marcus said they are still discretionary.  Patrick said at other schools these booster funds from parents are  put into supplies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said she is not comfortable with the Librarian being part of English. Marcus said literacy is one of our priorities.  Literacy should be taught through all the content areas.  The Librarian will work with all departments.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen asked if all the teachers from Newcomer have been placed. Marcus was not sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph felt that classroom teachers put in more hours than the counselors.  He said that teachers work on the weekends.  Counselors justified Bounmy for helping them with all the various tasks.  Perhaps the counselors should stay after school to do this work and come in on the weekends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren said counselors do not take a prep, they work on the weekends.  Lauren said she stays until 4, 4:30 or 5 and she takes work home for letters of recommendations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Stan said the district’s idea about this budget is divisive for the school.  Why can’t we tell the district we won’t accept this and ask them to use their reserve? He said we would tell the district it is unreasonable to take a 7.5% cut when the district has a big pool of money.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he must turn in a budget by March 23rd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said that we need to have our strength of community.  He feels the rainy day fund will be released.  We should cut to the bone on supplies—0 like GWHS has done for the last several years.  The budget will come back to us.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said he supports what Bounmy does but we are fat on secretarial staff.  Lincoln has the same amount of clerical as we do.  Washington has the same amount of clerical as Galileo and they have more students.  Patrick would like to see the cuts across the board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethan said PE has 137 students who did not pass the Physical Fitness Exam and they must take PE all 4 years.  We are the only school in the district that gives PE credit for athletics—this is to make sure class sizes are lower.  Now the PE department will not sign off on this. He mentioned ROTC and now it is an elective class while PE is Core curriculum.  Only PE credits can be given for ROTC if the instructor has a PE credential.  He sees class sizes of 55 with only 4 PE teachers.</p>
<p>He also mentioned 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> grade curriculum for PE.  Will the 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> grade classes be combined?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said if his figures were right, we might have to add 2 more PE teachers to make sure all students are covered.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick said we should leave it like it is and then we are OK in the fall.  Ethan is worried that teachers we want would be consolidated and would go elsewhere and not want to come back if more money comes our way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle wanted to know about electives in English.  She also asked if they could forgo the electives to reduce class sizes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen is worried about losing competent teachers and picking up teachers who do not speak English well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethan said the administration has done an outstanding job of hiring new teachers that are a good fit for the culture and climate of the school.  He mentioned the test scores, and he also mentioned the Superintendent’s Zone.  We have raised our API scores.  Why are we not being protected?  He felt we should be projected and this should be put to the Central Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Karin asked what would happen if we submit a budget that is not balanced.  We have never done it.  Marcus said we have to turning a balanced budget and we cannot protect anyone. We can have a priority list if we get more funds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Denise talked about a similar situation that happened last year, although not with as many cuts. We want to teach and to teach well.  Marcus said the administrators do advocate as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren said with AVID they take from the academic middle—2.5-3.3 students.  AVID ups the AP funds with their students.  AA, AI and Pacific Islander are higher percentage in AVID then the general population.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph wanted to know about the cuts—are these based on seniority?  He said VPA has a 1-year requirement.  PE has a 2-year requirement.  How can we meet the requirements with the same number of sections?</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle said if we cut AVID, we should be looking for professional development for English teachers to include those methodologies in their English classes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next steps:  UBC meeting after school today, SSC meeting tomorrow.  Marcus is not sure what to do with the PE situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick asked for another version of the “Talking Points” with a change in PE by the end of the day.  The administration said,” Yes.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Jessica suggested taking names off comments from the minutes.</p>
