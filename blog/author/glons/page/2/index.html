<p align="center"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Leadership Team/Department Heads Meeting</span></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span></b></p>
<p align="center"><b>3/10/15</b></p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>Nancy called the meeting to order at 11:25am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.  “For Profit” Nominations</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren distributed information on an organization that she felt was not represented correctly.  These letters go home and she is concerned that students go through the process.  The organization puts one of our teacher’s names on the letter.  Please let your teachers know about these unauthorized letters.  This program costs the student $2,000 &#8211; $3,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.  Teacher/Department Budget Priorities</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said her department programs were cut $4,000.  Priorities are tutoring program and class sizes.  She also mentioned a possible 7<sup>th</sup> period study hall.  Parents were in favor of that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Stephen Jackson talked about improving classrooms—like smart board in Room 362—from the school budget, not spec. Ed. budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alan—Library—keep a full time librarian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mat – Social Studies—would like status quo.</p>
<p>VAPA—Joseph—restore dance, drama, and band.  He wonders about the fact that we have a little more money this year but lots of items on the chopping block.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Mark B.—sees his position at risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Alicia—World Languages—full time librarian, elective in World Languages. Community building school spirit or money to have activities that will build community spirit.  Offering sign language.  They would like a functioning language lab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Math—Doug said they would like to keep the same number of sections, class sizes as they are now.  Math would like to add an additional prep for another teacher to teach AP Stats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Science—for David—retain staff school-wide; maintain current class size, larger science budget for operating labs, safety issues maintained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>English—Michelle&#8211;# 1 maintain class size we have and slightly lower class sizes in 10<sup>th</sup> grade regular English.  This is where they have the bulk of D’s and F’s.  #2 priority is to retain the Librarian.  #3 Add electives that are humanity based.  Maintain current budget.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren for AVID.  3 years ago the program took a 40% cut.  Slowly get back to that point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren said for Counseling the EL position is necessary.</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan said Wellness is not part of the Galileo budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan for PE is class size.  Maintain what we have now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michelle asked why we would add a Science teacher if a current teacher could teach Biotech.  This would cost $92,000 and we only have a $70,000 surplus.  Why is this a priority?</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle about AVID.</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug asked what was the rational for the cut list to be generated.</p>
<p>&#8211;Alicia said she hated to see electives gone.  These make schools attractive to both students and parents.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marc talked about district paying for his benefits and fundraising for his salary.  He talked about what goes on behind the scenes with the academies and pathways.  There is a need for his position.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph agrees with Doug and Michelle as to why some of these cuts are being discussed.  He mentioned Eugene Wing with Leadership, Karin Lau with the budget, Librarian is necessary, Journalism and Yearbook help to build community and we should not cut them.  He advocates the PTSA position for increased use of School Loop.  More CPT should be planned for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat said we should preserve programs and not add programs.</p>
<p>&#8211;Alan echoed what has been said.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stephen J. echoed Alicia.  Electives are important to the school culture.  We need to make sure there are very good educational opportunities beyond the basics.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen mentioned the EL Coordinator prep.  She mentioned the many ELD cuts with new ELD students coming in.  ELD class sizes are larger this year. The Newcomer Counselor should be in the Counseling Office.  This should be separate from Parent Liaison.</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan talked about School Loop and what the PTSA says.  It is not a budgetary issue.  She agrees with the needs of electives. She supports a full time Librarian.</p>
<p>&#8211;She talked about the Parent Liaison and what they do in other schools.  Now this is with a counselor.  She talked about the Intervention Specialist.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren asked about the Leadership Class.  Eugene Wing had an ASB Prep, now he has an ASB class.  To manage the students without the prep or the class, it would be hard to make all the arrangements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan said we have tough decisions down the line.  We might look at alternatives, rather than eliminating programs.  We can look at these programs that have been around a long time and add to the culture.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said she thinks the list comes from the past few years.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said these are just possibilities and not all of the items will be cut.  She encouraged everyone to attend tomorrow’s SSC Community meeting.  It will be held in the library after school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned that many feel the need to have more electives.  We should look at electives we have and what could appeal to more students.  Maybe some can be clubs or after school classes.</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan mentioned the importance of electives.  We need a Library and choices for students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.  Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan mentioned the trip tomorrow to ”The Princess Project.”  Susan can take up to 70 girls.  Please let her know if you know of students who would like to go along.  Priorities should be seniors but other grades can attend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa mentioned the change in the yearly calendar.  The talent show is March 27, not March 20<sup>th</sup>.  It will be a double 4<sup>th</sup> period schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 12:05pm.</p>

<p><b> </b></p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 11:20am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Debrief about today’s Emergency Evacuation Drill</p>
<p>&#8211;We had many subs today and they evacuated but did not know the directions.  We need to get a cheat sheet for evacuations for our daily subs.</p>
<p>&#8211;We may need an announcement along with the fire alarm.  Marcus said no matter what evacuate.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stephen Jackson asked about the evacuation routes.  Nancy said she feels that some classes have changed routes and the bottlenecks seem less for his evacuation route.</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan suggested a half sheet for subs to tell them what to do.  She suggested using all staff, like paras, secretaries and even the accountant on Tuesdays.</p>
<p>&#8211;David mentioned different class periods will have different amounts of traffic as we cross the street.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus saw 2 things—we need to make individual evacuation plans for students in wheel chairs and we need to learn how to use the evacuation chairs.  This should be for every student for every period.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa mentioned no one would have known where Tammy was and how to evacuate her.  She also suggested bright yellow vests along with the stop signs for those faculty being crossing guards.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren felt it was very messy on the field.  She said in an actual emergency it would be hard to take attendance.  The students were not getting in lines.  With online attendance it is difficulty to take attendance on the field.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stephen Jackson mentioned he and Nurse Kitchell are still in charge of food water and blankets.  They have no idea how much to get.  Marcus asked JROTC to put that plan together.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy asked who would pay for all these supplies.  How much water?  Portable toilets would be necessary.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stephen Emmi mentioned he is part of the field command center but he is not sure what he is supposed to do.  It is important for teachers to go with their students to their assigned line.</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan Kitchell said teachers on prep showed up at the command center and helped.  This should be handled at the first PD of the school year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said for attendance on the field—every teacher should have a copy of the class roster and keep it with their emergency supplies then they will have a hard copy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         EL Students’ CELDT Scores</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen handed out all the CELDT scores for each department.  Kathleen explained the components of the form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       EWI Students</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the EWI stands for Early Warning Indicators—identified in middle school with 2 issues—attendance and grades.  3 principals—Balboa, Washington and Galileo are meeting to figure out what we are doing as a school and what we need to do to improve.</p>
<p>&#8211;GW has retained 45% of 9<sup>th</sup> graders who have made it to the 11<sup>th</sup> grade.  Gal—44% and Balboa statistic was not presented.</p>
<p>&#8211;We have gathered these students to talk with them about what is working for them.  They did a videotape and we will see the video at our next meeting.  He distributed a list of the students and this also indicates which students were in the interview.  These students are the success stories and we want to learn from them.  He talked about the questions they put to the students.  Marcus said it was a very good conversation.</p>
<p>&#8211;A unifying theme was to be a more serious student in the 9<sup>th</sup> grade.  Attendance should have been better.  Family structure is important.  They were asked if they have a positive relationship with one adult in the building and most of them said they did.</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan asked what are we doing about the parents and how they value/not value higher education.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph suggested we pay these students to go to class, via a raffle.  Money talks.</p>
<p>&#8211;All the students learned to be resiliency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.  Budget/ School Wide Priorities</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle M. asked if we are shifting priorities?  Marcus asked everyone to go back to their departments to ask how the members feel.  He distributed a list of priorities.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said we have our SSC Summit on Saturday and we will be discussing this item.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we can improve on CAHSEE.  We should do more next year on this.</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan said she would like to do better on Free and Reduced Lunch to capture the students who need to eat.  She also suggested Grab and Go 2 around 10:00am.  She also said we need some incentive to have the students turn in the forms.  She also mentioned that often students come to her for food.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said “Off the Grid” does fundraisers, but this can only be for adults.</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan asked about the giant food machine in the hallway by 150.  It is too large for students to pass in an emergency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle asked about how the forms from the district were processed and distributed this year.  Susan asked if new students could fill out the form when they enroll, but the forms are not ready at that time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan asked what the $80,000 extra in our budget means.  Marcus said we are in the beginning stages of planning.</p>
<p>&#8211;David asked about some things we lost from last year.  Marcus mentioned we lost an Attendance Office.   ELAC wanted a study skills class during a 7<sup>th</sup> period.  Marcus said we are working on that right now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa talked about request from the PTSA, on Phone System, Web Site, Communication, etc.  We will have to designate some funds to someone to update our web site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked everyone to check with their departments for their thoughts and ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan said next week she is taking 70 girls to the Princess Project to shop for Prom dresses.  Each girl will have a personal shopper who helps her.  They get a free dress and one accessory.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said next year’s Prom will be at the Intercontinental Hotel on April 23, 2016.  He also asked for chaperones for the Boat Dance on March 14, 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 12:20pm.</p>

<p><b> </b></p>
<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 11:20am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Computer Lab</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle M. asked about the hours for the computer lab. Marcus said 7am – 5pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Wellness Staff Survey</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle F. mentioned this survey is done every other year.  It is all computerized now. The goal is 80% of the staff should complete this.  There is a raffle for a $15 Safeway card.  She is asking for feedback on the best way to do this.  Lisa suggested completing it in department meetings.  It takes 10 minutes and is due sometime in May.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said she could organize the paras to complete it on an early release day.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle will send out the link to the whole faculty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       Budget</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we saw a $700,000 increase in the budget for next year, but due to the raises this increase just covers all of the raises in all of the positions.  The bottom line is an $80,000 increase, not even enough for 1 teaching position.</p>
<p>&#8211;Ethan mentioned the cost of district teachers on special assignment totaling about $3 million dollars taking funds away from the students.  These teachers work from the special assignment budget.  Susan indicated these funds are usually taken from grant funds.  She said this is an out of credential teaching funding.  The issue is the way this district spends the money they get from the state.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he is concerned about security aides, Peer Resources and JROTC.</p>
<p>&#8211;Nancy said the district is encouraging us to offer an Ethnic Studies class to 9<sup>th</sup> graders next year.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked what class 9<sup>th</sup> graders would drop to take this class.  It could be Social Studies or VAPA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;1975 students is the allocation for the fall.  This will include a decrease in ELLs.  We should have about 388 ELLs next fall.</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph asked how many of the 45 allocated ELLs have arrived.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the good news is we won’t have to do any cutting.  We may have to do some adjusting.  He said we will present this to the SSC at tomorrow’s meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan asked if there has been any talk about closing under enrolled high schools.  Marcus said there is always talk of that, but nothing has happened so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Stephen Emmi said the counseling office will be visiting Social Studies classes next week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus congratulated Nancy who received a 3-year contract from the district.</p>
<p>&#8211;We also got the word that Stephen Emmi will be voted in at the SSC meeting tomorrow.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen mentioned those who just passed the National Boards and we have 10-15 on staff who have passed the National Boards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 11:42am.</p>

<p>Marcus called the meeting to order at 11:20am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.          Department Head Budget Priorities</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we would get next year’s budget on Monday.  The PTSA meets tonight for budget priorities.  He will meet with ELAC next week.  These will be the two community meetings.  He will give the budget to the SSC next week.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said the budget would be based on a class size of 33.  He is not sure what that means.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we have small class sizes in some areas and this could affect the budget.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus wants feedback on what the departments need.  What are our priorities?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa will run the community meeting tonight with the PTSA.  He put up a sheet detailing the items at the meeting.  He explained the agenda.  He explained the requests of the PTSA, current priorities—class size, Academy pathways, electives, co-teaching, and newcomers.  Central Office areas identified:  CAHSEE, Attendance, A-G grad track, Suspensions, G.P.A.  The district wants us to improve in these areas.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said we will have to increase the school-wide budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked for discussion or other priorities.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lauren wanted to add Special Programs to Academies and Pathways—AVID, Chinese Immersion.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said he would get some information on how many students are taking more than one class in specific areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.         Co-Teaching Placements 2015/16</p>
<p>&#8211;Stephen Jackson talked about feedback from this year.  Some teachers felt that had too many students with IEPs.  In Special Ed, Case Managers will look at each student and their schedules.  Perhaps some of these students do not need co-teachers.  They will analyze all of their students.  They will collect the data, and then present this to the general ed teachers.  He asked if there is anything else his department can do.</p>
<p>&#8211;Michelle mentioned that some of her classes have large numbers of students with IEPs and this can be overwhelming for the teachers.</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan said there is a special committee working with this issue in union bargaining.</p>
<p>&#8211;Registration will be during the first 2 weeks of March.</p>
<p>&#8211;February 27<sup>th</sup> during lunch will be the Academy &amp; Pathway Fair.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus said if anyone is proposing a course, please let admin know right away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.       AP Course Registration</p>
<p>&#8211;Mat said this is a good time to recruit for AP classes— via G-House TV, lunchtime.  Mat asked if counselors need a checklist for the courses.  Mat will email this information to Stephen Emmi.  Spreadsheets will be available for department heads to edit.</p>
<p>&#8211;Stephen Emmi said students know if they are being recommended for an AP class.</p>
<p>&#8211;Kathleen said there were no ELL students in AP language courses at this time.  They should be proficient in English before signing up for AP courses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV.        Timely Arrangements for Substitutes</p>
<p>&#8211;Please remind your teachers to plan ahead of time for teachers who know they will be absent.  Please contact subs and make arrangements ahead of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.         Computer Cart Sign-up</p>
<p>&#8211;Alicia mentioned some teachers had signed up for 10 days straight with the computer cart.  She mentioned the protocol and it does not seem to be the same as the labs.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa said it should be the same and she will edit the information.</p>
<p>&#8211;Alicia asked how many days in a row can a teacher sign up for the computer carts?  Lisa will clarify this.  Doug explained a situation with the math department and the new and old carts.  He also said his department shared the sign up of the cart, but one person signed out the carts for the whole department.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa talked about testing and the use of the carts and prep for testing.</p>
<p>&#8211;Lisa reminded teachers not to send substitutes to the computer lab when they are absent.  Lisa needs to approve reoccurring reservations.</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus asked Lisa to send out an email detailing the reservation policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI.        Senior Awards</p>
<p>&#8211;Marcus mentioned our last discussion about the Move-Up Assembly.  We will have a Move-Up Celebration this year and the ASB officers will do the “moving.”  This will turn into a carnival and food fest.</p>
<p>&#8211;Senior Awards Dinner—kids who are getting an award will be invited.  It will be in the gym with a catered dinner.  This will recognize academics as well as other awards.  She asked the group to brainstorm awards.</p>
<p>Beating the Odds Award.  LATA and TACT Scholarships, SF Achievers.  Most improved award.  Citizenship Award, Community Service Award (in and outside the Galileo community).</p>
<p>&#8211;Doug asked if this should be within departments.  Healthy Choice Award, Newcomer of the Year; Student Performance Award;  Teacher Pop Pole for students;</p>
<p>Marc suggested Most Creative Award Outside the Classroom;  Creativity Award;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211;Joseph said he would miss the ceremony at Move-up with the band and orchestra.  Marcus said this could still happen at the celebration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII.      Miscellaneous</p>
<p>&#8211;Susan sent an email to students and their parents about immunizations.  The box to put the responses in is in the Counseling Office.  Autodialer will go out today.  Deadline is March 1, 2015.  Susan explained the guidelines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 12:10pm.</p>
