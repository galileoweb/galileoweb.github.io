				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>my name is steve ruud and i live at lyon and lombard. it is a nice and secure environment. i am retired and when i grew up there were no computers. this is a new world to me and i need your help.<br />
for the right person this would be a regular, p/t job. $10 per hour. i have a video camera that i never used and a lot of gadgets.<br />
i also have a lot of paperwork and i need help to organize my place.<br />
i would like to have regular hours, for example two hours twice a week. this can be adjusted, but i like a regular schedule.</p>
<p>my phone number is 447 9760. i have lived in many countries so i know that the world is round, but i still have a lot to learn.<br />
it is a never ending process. we can learn from each other.</p>
<p>i would appreciate a resume by email (osruud@att.net) from each applicant. &#8211; Steve</p>
