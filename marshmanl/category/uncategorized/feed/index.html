				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the Youth Advisory Counselor, Asian Pacific Islander Legal Outreach&#8230;.</p>
<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>We are the Youth Advisory Council of Asian Pacific Islander Legal Outreach. Currently, we are recruiting new Youth Advisory Council (YAC) members for the 2012-2013 school year. As YAC, we outreach to peers in the community about issues such as domestic violence and dating violence through workshops, presentations, and events such as talent shows and poster contests. We also outreach through the many projects we do, which includes a wall mural, music videos, and websites. Also, in the summer, YAC holds a week-long day camp called API-ACT where Youth Advisory Council members, potential YAC members, and others interested learn about the Asian Pacific Islander culture.</p>
<p>Joining YAC will give rise to many volunteer opportunities. Not only do YAC members gain the knowledge and experience of domestic violence by outreaching to the community, but each individual also has the opportunity to improve their public speaking and leadership skills. YAC members also receive a stipend for attending outreach events and biweekly meetings.</p>
<p>If you or anyone you know is interested in joining YAC, or is interested in participating in API-ACT, please contact me via email or phone or visit <a href="http://www.thatsnotlove.org/" target="_blank">www.thatsnotlove.org</a> for more information. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Betty Chow<br />
Youth Outreach Coordinator<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Conservatory of Flowers invites high school students 16 years and older to become docents for their new Wicked Plants exhibit.</p>
<p>Wicked Plants Docents introduce visitors to the plant rogues and assassins that left their mark on history and claimed many an unfortunate victim. The Conservatory transforms the Special Exhibits Gallery into an eerie Victorian garden full of Mother Nature&#8217;s most appalling creations, all inspired by Amy Stewart&#8217;s New York Times Bestseller, Wicked Plants: The Weed that Killed Lincoln&#8217;s Mother &amp; Other Botanical Atrocities.</p>
<p>The free training for Wicked Plants docents will be held on March 30 from 5:00-6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Volunteers are asked to commit to a minimum of two three-hour shifts per month from April until the beginning of the fall semester. Volunteers may select their shifts, which are from 10:00-1:00 or 1:00-4:00 Tuesday-Sunday.</p>
<p>For more information or to sign up for the program, please contact Erika Frank, Director of Volunteer Services, at <a href="%28415%29%20637-4326" target="_blank">(415) 637-4326</a> or <a href="mailto:efrank@sfcof.org" target="_blank">efrank@sfcof.org</a>.</p>
