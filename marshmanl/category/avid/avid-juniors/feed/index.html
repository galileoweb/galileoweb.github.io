				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Conservatory of Flowers invites high school students 16 years and older to become docents for their new Wicked Plants exhibit.</p>
<p>Wicked Plants Docents introduce visitors to the plant rogues and assassins that left their mark on history and claimed many an unfortunate victim. The Conservatory transforms the Special Exhibits Gallery into an eerie Victorian garden full of Mother Nature&#8217;s most appalling creations, all inspired by Amy Stewart&#8217;s New York Times Bestseller, Wicked Plants: The Weed that Killed Lincoln&#8217;s Mother &amp; Other Botanical Atrocities.</p>
<p>The free training for Wicked Plants docents will be held on March 30 from 5:00-6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Volunteers are asked to commit to a minimum of two three-hour shifts per month from April until the beginning of the fall semester. Volunteers may select their shifts, which are from 10:00-1:00 or 1:00-4:00 Tuesday-Sunday.</p>
<p>For more information or to sign up for the program, please contact Erika Frank, Director of Volunteer Services, at <a href="%28415%29%20637-4326" target="_blank">(415) 637-4326</a> or <a href="mailto:efrank@sfcof.org" target="_blank">efrank@sfcof.org</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bay Area Youth Leadership Corps 2011<br />
This course is designed for high school students (generally 14-17 year olds) who are looking to improve their understanding of leadership, who are interested in a challenge, and are open to learning new skills.  In the school year following the trip, students participate in workshops, trainings, reunions and local service projects.</p>
<p>YLC is a full merit-based scholarship for a 14 day summer expedition, combined with post-course activities for the following school year. The program is designed to bring together a diverse group of students from across the greater Bay Area.  We are looking for candidates that demonstrate leadership qualities in their social, athletic and/or academic lives.</p>
<p>This 14 day rock climbing and backpacking expedition takes place in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of Eastern California. The Sierras are rugged and beautiful mountains that provide an inspiring Outward Bound experience which includes camping, map and compass navigation, and a unique solo experience.</p>
<p>There is no experience needed, and all instruction and equipment is provided by Outward Bound. OB provides transportation to and from the course area.  While on course, students will travel with all the food and gear they need to conduct the expedition: stoves, tents, etc.  The group may sleep in the same campsite twice, but generally will be moving to a new campsite as they hike along their expedition route. Gaining know-how by learning wilderness skills means students head home empowered and inspired!</p>
<p>The application process is simple: 1. Application form 2. Essay  3. One letter of recommendation 4. $100 application fee (this amount can be flexible and is returned to students who are not accepted).  Students are then contacted for an interview.  Applications are due March 25th.</p>
<p>More information can be found here &lt;http://www.outwardbound.org/index.cfm/do/obyc.bayarea_youth&gt; .</p>
