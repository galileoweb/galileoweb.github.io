				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Video Project must…</p>
<p><strong>HAVE MEANING:</strong> It should address an issue or concern. Viewers should be informed, educated or made aware of something, or – best of all – motivated to action because of your video. This doesn’t mean you have to hit people over the head with a message, and it doesn’t mean your video needs to be deadly serious. EXAMPLE: “A Girl Like Me” informed and educated; I didn’t know that African-American girls felt unattractive because of their skin color or hair texture.</p>
<p><strong>HAVE PASSION:</strong> The leader of the team should promote a topic that she/he feels passionate about. Other than making video what do you care about? EXAMPLE: Different students may be passionate about abandoned pets, or adding bike lanes to Polk Street, or preparing for a Robotics Competition.</p>
<p><strong>USE ONLY COPYRIGHT-FREE MATERIAL:</strong> Do not choose topics that would require use of copyrighted music or images or video. You can make use of work from Creative Commons (with proper attribution). EXAMPLE: This is why local topics are usually preferable to international issues. If you need B-roll of the crisis in Syria, it will likely be someone else’s copyrighted photos or video.</p>
<p><strong>BE LARGE ENOUGH:</strong> Is the plan for your video big enough to warrant having 3 or 4 students work for two months? EXAMPLE: You could videotape the Chinese New Year Parade and edit it in one or two weeks. How can you expand this project beyond just showing the parade?</p>
<p><strong>PRESENT CHALLENGES:</strong> You can request interviews with school board members or members of the board of supervisors. Most people are friendly and open to being interviewed by a video crew of high school students, even if you approach strangers on the street.  You may feel intimidated doing things like this – that’s all the more reason to do it! Challenge yourself and grow!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each team will create a Person-on-the-Street Video. The theme of the PoS videos is EDUCATION.</p>
<h4>STEP 1: THE QUESTIONS</h4>
<ul>
<li>Your team must come up with 3 questions that you will ask your interview subjects.</li>
<li>These must NOT be Yes-No questions. The questions must require more explanation in an answer.</li>
<li>The three questions should be on a common theme, so that when the answers are edited together there is a logical flow/story to your movie.</li>
<li>When you have 3 questions bring them to Mr. Machtay for approval.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>STEP 2: THE INTERVIEWS</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Are your questions aimed at students? At incoming freshmen? At seniors? At students who are currently applying for college? At teachers?</li>
<li>What will you use for a backdrop? Blank backdrop behind everyone? Same backdrop behind everyone? Similar backdrop behind everyone?</li>
<li>RULE OF THIRDS! Do not center your subject! Subject can be on screen right (2/3 of frame) facing left, or on screen left (2/3 of frame) facing right.</li>
<li>Consistent sizes in frame. Don&#8217;t show one person in a super close up and the next person in a medium shot waist up. Be consistent.</li>
<li>MICROPHONES! Use lavalier mics.</li>
<li>SUBJECT DOESN&#8217;T LOOK INTO CAMERA! Interviewer should stand next to the camera. The subject should look at the interview and not into the camera.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>STEP 2A: THE TEAM</strong></h4>
<p>During interviews you need a team of 4 people:</p>
<ul>
<li>DIRECTOR: Decides how shot will be framed, what to use for backdrop. Could also be interviewer.</li>
<li>CAMERAPERSON: Operates the camera</li>
<li>SOUND PERSON: Makes sure microphone is working correctly. Wears headphones to make sure sound is coming through microphone.</li>
<li>WRANGLER/TAPE LOG: This person&#8217;s job is to line up the next interview subject and to keep track of a Tape Log — which shots/which replies are best and should be used in the finished video. This person also keeps the background clear and makes sure there are no disturbances during shoot. Could also be interviewer.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also videotape with a team of three. In this case the director and wrangler are combined into one job.</p>
<h4><strong>POST PRODUCTION</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Your team needs B-Roll, cut-away footage, so we&#8217;re not just looking at talking heads. While two of you are uploading footage of the interviews, the other two team members can video B-Roll.</li>
<li>Make sure the B-Roll is appropriate for what&#8217;s being said on screen.</li>
<li>DUE TUESDAY OCTOBER 13th.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don&#8217;t make reference to suicide. Don&#8217;t show people starting physical fights. Don&#8217;t use language inappropriate for school. Show that bullying hurts people; bullying is a dumb, childish thing to do; and that standing up against bullying is a positive thing.</p>
<p>One interesting fact: 30% of kids who are bullies in school end up spending some time in jail as adults.</p>

<p>This is the information that must be included: &#8220;Dark Nights, City Lights,&#8221; Galileo Homecoming Dance, October 2nd, Hyatt Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf.</p>
<p>The commercial should be 30-45 seconds. It should make the dance seem appealing. You can make your commercial exciting, or romantic, or funny — people always remember funny commercials. Keep in mind: Your job is to convince students to buy tickets to the dance. You are SELLING the dance!</p>
<p>We need one for next week&#8217;s broadcast. Then we need a different one each week between now and the dance on October 2nd.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last 10 years Galileo has been the only SFUSD school with a broadcast that includes both live and pre-taped portions.</p>
<p>This year we&#8217;re going to switch to a pre-taped broadcast. The goal is that each week&#8217;s broadcast would be available on the Galileoweb site as of Wednesday morning. Homeroom teachers can then choose to show the broadcast on Channel 72, as usual. Or to show it through a computer and projector.</p>
<p>The live broadcast will end with LIVE ANNOUNCEMENTS. We will switch to a live announcer for last minute announcements. Therefore we need a small crew in the Broadcast Room during homeroom.</p>
<p>MR. MACHTAY&#8217;S DECREE: 6TH PERIOD WILL BE IN CHARGE OF BROADCAST FALL SEMESTER. 5TH PERIOD WILL TAKE OVER SPRING SEMESTER.</p>
<p>We need segment producers and segment teams.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Team in charge of College &amp; Career, Scholarship &amp; Work opportunities.</li>
<li>A Team in charge of School Activities: ASB, Pep Rallies, Assemblies, etc.</li>
<li>A Team in charge of Athletics: Get the scores (and info about the game) each Monday morning. Keep track of upcoming games.</li>
<li>We need to talk about how to make each of these the best it can be. What else will we need for the broadcast?</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need students to take charge of:</p>
<p>Calendar Manager: Keep track of what events are coming up. One student should make sure there are commercials in advance of events. Another student should make sure that there&#8217;s someone from Media Arts scheduled to video the event.</p>
<p>Production Manager: Keep track of every school-related project from the time it&#8217;s in the camera until it is a finished video on Galileoweb. This student will maintain a spreadsheet of the work flow.</p>
<p>Equipment Manager: With two classes there are no extra cameras. Keep track of who is taking out a camera at the end of class. Each class has its own equipment room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ms. Yalon from Career-Tech Ed office is coming to class on Monday to guide you in how to fill out a job application.</p>
<p>You need to prepare over the weekend and<br />
<strong>BRING THESE THINGS ON MONDAY:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bring a print out of your Resume! Print it on Friday if you need to. (We can&#8217;t waste class time on Monday having you all log in to print out your resumes.)</li>
<li>Bring Identification: Xeroxes of your social security card or birth certificate, driver&#8217;s license of California ID. Also a copy of your most recent (end of last semester) report card. You will need these points of identification for any internship or job.</li>
<li>Blue or black pen and a pencil for filling out the application.</li>
<li>Also have information about your references and their contact information. You cannot use parents or relatives for references. You can ask teachers or coaches (if they know you are responsible and hard working).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ESSAY PROMPTS FOR CTE INTERNSHIP APPLICATION</strong><br />
Write the following in a thoughtful manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>How has your high school experience prepared you for an internship? How will an internship support/help your learning? (300-500 words)</li>
<li>List the skills you think make you a great candidate for a summer internship. (Computer skills, interpersonal skills, foreign language)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MS. YALON&#8217;S VISIT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU!</strong> If you&#8217;re not prepared for this opportunity, that says a lot about whether you are prepared for an internship or a job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
