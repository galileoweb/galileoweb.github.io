				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><span style="color: #993366;">This week is about FUNCTIONAL design. </span></h4>
<p>If you design (and produce) a spoon or a table or a shirt, your finished product has a FUNCTION. Also, you must consider how the raw materials FUNCTION. (Raw Materials examples: spoon = metal; chair = wood; shirt = fabric)</p>
<h4><strong>FIRST: CREATE YOUR OWN COUNTRY</strong></h4>
<p>Is your country on an island? Are there beaches? Mountains? Big Cities? Are you the president? The king? You could decide you want California to break off and become its own country. Or maybe San Francisco should declare itself a country? <img src="http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Have fun with this.</p>
<h4><strong><a href="http://galileoweb.org/machtayh/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2015/10/2machtayflag.gif"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1714 alignright" src="http://galileoweb.org/machtayh/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2015/10/2machtayflag-300x150.gif" alt="2machtayflag" width="300" height="150" /></a>FLAG (300px ht x 600px w, saved as a GIF)</strong></h4>
<p>Flags are most often made from fabric. Therefore, plan a design that is simple geometric shapes (that could be cut out and sewn together in fabric). Choose colors and shapes that represent your country.</p>
<p>Make sure your design could be produced in fabric! No pictures. No gradients. No drop shadows. Just SOLID GEOMETRIC SHAPES!</p>
<p>Your flag could be very simple â€” look at the flags of Japan, or Norway, or Ireland. But, if you&#8217;re going to make a design that&#8217;s a simple &#8220;X&#8221; make sure the X is perfectly centered and even spacing in all four corners. If you&#8217;re going to design a flag that has three horizontal lines, make sure the lines are the same size.</p>
<p>You can make the flag simple, but make it carefully so it&#8217;s precise and neat.</p>
<h4><strong>PAPER MONEYÂ </strong></h4>
<p>The #1 priority for paper money printed by countries today is STOPPING COUNTERFEITERS. This means using intricate patterns that overlap. When you look closely at the background you can often see layers of images.</p>
<p>Choose colors that represent your country. RepeatÂ colors and shapes that you used on your flag.</p>
<h4><strong><a href="http://galileoweb.org/machtayh/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2015/10/3machtaymoney.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1715 alignleft" src="http://galileoweb.org/machtayh/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2015/10/3machtaymoney-300x150.jpg" alt="3machtaymoney" width="300" height="150" /></a>FRONT OF MONEY (300px ht x 600px w, saved as a JPG)</strong></h4>
<p>Use a face on the front of your money â€” photograph or painting (do not use a cartoon or drawing). Apply a filter to the picture.</p>
<p>Place the value of the money in at least 2 corners of the money (preferably in all 4). Make sure the value is easy to read.</p>
<p>In a smaller typeface write the name of your country (full legal name).</p>
<p>For the background, use multiple layers (lower opacity on the upper layers so they&#8217;re see-through). Mr. Machtay will demonstrate how to use Dingbats effectively and how to change Opacity on layers. Make the background intricate and difficult to counterfeit. Also use symbols as ornaments (behind a picture, behind the amount of the money).</p>
<h4><strong>BACK OF MONEYÂ <strong>(300px ht x 600px w, saved as a JPG)</strong></strong></h4>
<p>Use a picture of a building or a landscape â€” once again, not a cartoon or a drawing. Once again apply a filter.</p>
<p>Place the value of the money the same as you did on the front.</p>
<p>Make a different background for the back of the money. But make sure you&#8217;re using the same/similar imagery and shapes, and keeping with your country&#8217;s colors.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You will create a folder called 2lastnameinsects.</p>
<p>This will be a multi-part project and you will place all JPGs from this assignment into your 2lastnameinsects folder.</p>
<h5>THE ASSIGNMENT</h5>
<p>80% of cultures around the world eat insects. But most Western countries do not.Â Some believe thatÂ the solution to world hunger is using insects as a source of food.</p>
<p>So, how would you market food made from insects to appeal to American teenagers? Come up with a product and a name.</p>
<h5>THE LOGO</h5>
<p>The first part of this project, you will create 3 Logos for your product. Each logo will be 400px X 400px, saved as JPG.</p>
<p>Mr. Machtay will review with the class: What makes a good logo? There should not be a lot of extra space between lines of type. Group things together so that you create a design out of the lettering.</p>
<p>What colors and what typefaces will you select to represent your product? What designs will appeal to a teen audience?</p>
<p>Most logos don&#8217;t have pictures. They may have simple shapes that represent the product or emphasize the letters in the name. Consider logos on products that you like.</p>
<h5>THE ADVERTISEMENTS</h5>
<p>Mr. Machtay will review your 3 logos and help you select one to use in your advertisements. The class will look at some print advertisements and consider what makes some ads more effective than others (especially in appealing to teens).</p>
<p>Each ad is 400px W x 600px Ht, saved as JPG, and has:</p>
<ul>
<li>PICTURE(s) â€” it could be one or more pictures. It may show the product, but more important it should show how the product makes people feel (happy?).</li>
<li>LOGO â€” depending on the ad design, the logo could be large or small. But it should be clear and readable.</li>
<li>SLOGAN â€” &#8220;Coke, it&#8217;s the real thing.&#8221; &#8220;Apple, think different.&#8221; &#8220;Burger King, have it your way.&#8221; Find a short, catchy slogan for your product.</li>
<li>ADDITIONAL WORDS â€” Do you need to add some more words toÂ help communicate your vision of the product? To help convince people to buy and eat this product?</li>
<li>&#8230; And don&#8217;t forget: PRINCIPLES OF GOOD LAYOUT! Grouping, Alignment, Repetition, Variety, Balance.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong><span style="color: #800080;">Hand in a folder called 2lastnameschools, due Friday, October 16th.</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #800080;">Inside the folder you will include 4 JPGs, each one 400px wide by 600px ht.</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #800080;">Each JPG will include 3 different designs for logos for a school.</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #800080;">Students need to understand GROUPING and HIERARCHY with text.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://galileoweb.org/machtayh/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2014/10/sch_snobhaven.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1656 alignleft" src="http://galileoweb.org/machtayh/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2014/10/sch_snobhaven-300x300.jpg" alt="sch_snobhaven" width="300" height="300" /></a>You have been hired to create branding and identification by a company that opens for-profit schools. Each school needs a logo that represents its unique identity.</p>
<p>The logo needs to work large painted on the side of a building, and also small as a patch on a shirt.</p>
<p>For each school, start a Photoshop file 400px wide by 600px high.</p>
<p>On this file you will create three different logos for that school.</p>
<p>Use different typefaces for each logo. Use different layer styles, patterns, shapes. You cannot use images or cartoons, but you can use shapes or dingbats.</p>
<p>Your design must communicate what kind of school this is just using lettering.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">School 1:Â <strong>SnobHaven Academy for Proper Young Ladies &amp; Gentlemen</strong></span><br />
This is a very high-pricedÂ school that boasts personalized service to its students. The school wants everyone to know how exclusive and expensive it is. The parents who spend a lot of money to send their children to SnobHaven want everyone to know how rich they are and how special the school is.</p>
<p>Design should reflect<strong> Expensive &amp; Exclusive</strong>.Â Make sure you get the entire name correct! Consider HIERARCHY in the size of the different words.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><a href="http://galileoweb.org/machtayh/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2014/10/sch_einsteininstitute.gif"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1658 alignright" src="http://galileoweb.org/machtayh/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2014/10/sch_einsteininstitute-300x300.gif" alt="sch_einsteininstitute" width="300" height="300" /></a>School 2:Â </span><strong><span style="color: #993366;">Einstein Science Institute</span></strong><br />
Students here have the best microscopes, centrifuges and computers. They all work on advanced experiments. This school only accepts the very brightest science students and gives them challenging work to do.</p>
<p>Design should reflect:<strong> Serious. Scientific. Technologically Advanced.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">School 3:<strong>Â Learn thru Play Pre-School</strong></span><br />
This school wants to project an image of being fun and playful, but also a place for the youngest students to learn.</p>
<p><a href="http://galileoweb.org/machtayh/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2014/10/sch_learnthruplay.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1659 alignleft" src="http://galileoweb.org/machtayh/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2014/10/sch_learnthruplay-218x300.jpg" alt="sch_learnthruplay" width="218" height="300" /></a>Design should reflect <strong>Bright Colors &amp; Shapes that appeal to little children</strong> (and their parents). Communicate that this is <strong>a Happy Place</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">School 4:Â <strong>Oldenburg Institute of Fashion &amp; Design</strong></span><br />
This school only accepts the best artists. They expect the highest quality of art and design work and their logo/identity must reflect that.</p>
<p>Design should reflect colors and design elements that are <strong>Artistic, Stylish, Creative</strong>. Remember Hierarchy with the name</p>
<p><strong>GROUPING:</strong>Â One of the four principles of layout presented earlier this semester (Grouping, Alignment, Repetition, Variety). Lines of type should not float disconnected in the image. Create a relationship between the lines of type. This is best done by putting individual lines (or individual words) on their own layers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://galileoweb.org/machtayh/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2014/10/sch_oldenburg.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1660 alignright" src="http://galileoweb.org/machtayh/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2014/10/sch_oldenburg-300x300.jpg" alt="sch_oldenburg" width="300" height="300" /></a>HIERARCHY:</strong>Â If you make every word large and extra-bold then nothing will stand out. Hierarchy refers to &#8220;rankings.&#8221; In the name &#8220;Galileo Academy of Science &amp; Technology&#8221; the word with the highest ranking would be &#8220;Galileo.&#8221; The word with the lowest ranking would be &#8220;of.&#8221; As the designer, you need to help the viewer know what is most important and where to look first.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER TIPS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use Alignment where appropriate</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t mix two typefaces that are too similar (two script typefaces, two serif typefaces). Use a serif with a sans-serif. Use an unusual typeface with a very plain typeface.</li>
<li>Put lines of type on different layers so you can move them around and create a design.</li>
<li>But, make sure youÂ <strong>GIVE THE CLIENT THREEÂ DIFFERENTÂ CHOICES FOR EACH SCHOOL!</strong></li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You will create covers for books you read in English class. Each of the covers will be MONOCHROMATIC (one color family), 400px W x 600px Ht, and saved as a JPG.</p>
<p><strong>Create a folder in your Documents folder. Name the new folder <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2lastnamebooks.</span></strong></p>
<p>Inside that folder you will place one book cover for the Odyssey, and 3 book covers for a book (of your choice) that you read in English class in the last two years.</p>
<h5>THE ODYSSEY</h5>
<p>You will create a new Photoshop file 400px W x 600px Ht. When file is complete itÂ will be named &#8220;2lastnameodyssey.jpg.&#8221;</p>
<ul>
<li>FirstÂ do a Google image search for &#8220;Odysseus&#8221; â€” that&#8217;s the main character in Homer&#8217;s &#8220;The Odyssey.&#8221; You can also search for &#8220;Ancient Greece,&#8221; &#8220;Map of Greece,&#8221; or any specific scene from the story of Odysseus&#8217;s journey.</li>
<li>Insert your images into the new file.</li>
<li>Mr. Machtay will show you how to remove the colors from the image (image &gt; adjustments &gt; desaturate).</li>
<li>Then Mr. Machtay will show you how to apply a new color to the image (image &gt; adjustments &gt; color balance).</li>
<li>Screen uses RGB Color (Red-Green-Blue). Note that Cyan (Green + Blue) is the opposite of Red. Magenta (Blue + Red) is the opposite of Green. And Yellow (Red + Green) is the opposite of Blue. (We will learn more about the RGB Color Wheel Spring semester.)</li>
<li>Choose a color to use for the Odyssey book cover. You can combine colors at different settings. For instance: Cyan at 50, Blue at 25.Â The story of The Odyssey takes place on water. This greenish-blue color suggests water.</li>
<li>Place the words &#8220;The Odyssey&#8221; in a prominent place. Make sure the words are easy to read. Make sure the words are not covering an important part of a picture. Then place the words &#8220;by Homer.&#8221; The author&#8217;s credit should be smaller than the name of the book. Once again make sure the words areÂ well placed in your design.</li>
<li>Save your file as a JPG (2lastnameodyssey.jpg) and place in folder (2lastnamebooks).</li>
</ul>
<h5>3 BOOK COVERSâ€”Monochromatic (one color family)</h5>
<ul>
<li>Now choose a book you read in English class sometime in the last two years. (It cannot be Manga or a picture book!)</li>
<li>Search for pictures for your book cover. You must NOT use pictures from a movie version of the book.</li>
<li>Combine at least two pictures.Â Be careful with placement of the book title and the author&#8217;s name. Make sure they&#8217;re easy to read and not hiding an important part of the image.</li>
<li>Save each completed book cover as a JPG. (2lastnamebookcover1.jpg) Place into your folder (2lastnamebooks).</li>
</ul>
<h5>IMPORTANT: You have learned FILTERS, LAYER STYLES, LAYER MASKS, CUT-OUTS. You have also learned PRINCIPLES OF GOOD LAYOUT. Show what you&#8217;ve learned!</h5>
<p>Due at the end of block day this week October 7-8.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mr. Machtay will demonstrate the use of Layer Masks.</p>
<p>In your CART1 folder open the file called &#8220;layermasks.psd.&#8221; Mr. Machtay will demonstrate how to create a layer mask out of the letters in GALILEO; then how to create a layer mask in the shape of a lion; finally how to do a gradient layer mask. Follow all of these steps.</p>
<p>You will use Layer Masks in each of the three posters you will produce this week.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">San Francisco photos can be found in pickupdropoff &gt; machtayh &gt; pickup &gt; sfpics folder.</span></p>
<h4>ADVERTISEMENTS FOR SAN FRANCISCO: 3 Different Posters, 400px wide by 600px ht, 72ppi, hand in JPG.</h4>
<p>An Advertisement sells a product. In this case, the product you will sell is the City of San Francisco. You want to encourage people to visit San Francisco (the number one industry in SF is tourism). You want to encourage people who live here to go out and enjoy the city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ELEMENTS OF AN ADVERTISEMENT</strong></p>
<p>Make 3 DIFFERENT posters â€” different typefaces, different pictures, different designs, different filters, different layer styles, and different colors.</p>
<p>You must use at least 2 different pictures on each poster. Use Layer Masks to combine the different pictures into one image. Make sure the picture communicates your message.</p>
<p>There must be a slogan â€” a short statement that tells your message. (e.g., &#8220;Enjoy San Francisco,&#8221; &#8220;Beautiful San Francisco,&#8221; &#8220;Have Fun in San Francisco,&#8221; &#8220;Experience San Francisco,&#8221; &#8220;San Francisco â€” Beautiful&#8221;Â &#8230; or you can do some research, find out facts about the city, and use a short statement on your posters).</p>
<p>Make the slogan part of the design! Don&#8217;t put multiple lines of type on one layer â€” put each line on its own layer so you can move them around and manipulate the design. Be careful where you position the type â€” don&#8217;t cover somebody&#8217;s face or an important part of the picture with words. Make sure the type is readable â€” use Layer Styles if you need to.)</p>
<p>Do your best! Hand in JPGs at the end of block day September 30th-October 1st.</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #333333;"><strong><br />
PART ONE: LOGOS</strong></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>On Block Day you will design <strong>3 different Logos</strong> for your team on one Photoshop file <strong>600px by 600px (save as JPG)</strong>. Make all 3 <strong>DIFFERENT &#8212; different typefaces, different designs, different colors</strong>. (Your client wants choices.)</li>
<li>Keep the Logo simple. You don&#8217;t want photographs in the logo. Just simple shapes. Remember, this has to go on hats and onto ads that will include other images.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PART TWO: ADS</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1703 alignleft" src="http://galileoweb.org/machtayh/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2015/10/sportsad1-200x300.jpg" alt="sportsad1" width="200" height="300" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Mr. Machtay will give feedback on your logos. Take the feedback and improve one of your logos.Then you will use that logo on the rest of this assignment.</li>
<li>Now produce <strong>3 Advertisements</strong> for your team. Each ad will be <strong>400px wide by 600px ht (save as JPGs)</strong>.</li>
<li>Your ads should all be part of <strong>one unified AD CAMPAIGN</strong>. (Mr. Machtay will show samples of Ad Campaigns.) Ad Campaign should use the <strong>SAME typeface, same colors, same design elements</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PART THREE: &#8220;STUFF&#8221;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now design a T-shirt and a hat for your team.</li>
<li>The <strong>T-shirt design</strong> should be <strong>400px wide by 600px ht (save as JPG)</strong>. You can use as many colors as you want. Make it something people would want to buy.</li>
<li>The <strong>Hat design</strong> should be <strong>400px by 400px (save as GIF)</strong> and it should be <strong>ONLY ONE COLOR</strong>! So you have to make a very simple design â€” simple but representing your team and appealing enough that people would buy it.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mr. Machtay will review 4 Principles of Good Layout. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>GROUP/GROUPING</li>
<li>ALIGN/ALIGNMENT</li>
<li>REPEAT/REPETITION</li>
<li>VARY/VARIETY</li>
<li>and in the case of the second assignment, we&#8217;re addingÂ BALANCE!</li>
</ul>
<p>You are going to work onÂ two different PSD files in your CART1 folder:</p>
<h5>TYPOGRAPHY.PSD</h5>
<p><a href="http://galileoweb.org/machtayh/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2015/09/typographylayout.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1609 alignright" src="http://galileoweb.org/machtayh/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2015/09/typographylayout-200x300.jpg" alt="typographylayout" width="200" height="300" /></a>Mr. Machtay will hand out printed versions of what the completed Typography page should look like. You will try to match the layout in the printed version.</p>
<p>Be careful about alignment! Mr. Machtay will show you how to use Rulers in Photoshop. Make sure everything on the left side is aligned left. Make sure the space between the images and the words is consistent, the same for all the text boxes.</p>
<p>You will have to change the size of the images. Make sure you hold down Shift and keep these images in proportion.</p>
<p>You will change the typefaces and sizes of the different textboxes. From the top they will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helvetica 10pt, with Helvetica Bold 12 pt headline</li>
<li>Garamond 12pt, Bold headline</li>
<li>Times New Roman, 11pt, Bold headline</li>
<li>Trebuchet 10pt, Bold headline</li>
</ul>
<h5>ARTISTS.PSD</h5>
<p>On the first Layout assignment you had to matchÂ an existing layout, everything lined up and formal. On ARTISTS.PSD you will design your own page. But as you design keep in mind: GROUPING, ALIGNMENT, REPETITION, VARIETY and BALANCE.</p>
<p>Imagine you are the Art Director for a Magazine. The Magazine Editor gives you these images and these short paragraphs of information. You need to design the page for the Magazine. Create a headline for the page that says &#8220;20th Century Artists.&#8221;</p>
<p>You will have to make the images smaller (make sure you hold down shift and keep the images in proportion). All the images don&#8217;t need to be the same size. But the text in all the textboxes should be the same (otherwise you give more importance to one artist than to the others).</p>
<p><strong>GROUPING:</strong> Make sure the correct paragraph is matched with the correct image. When someone looks at your page they should easily know which paragraph goes with which image. If it&#8217;s confusing, if there&#8217;sÂ a paragraph that&#8217;s hanging between two images, you did it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>ALIGNMENT:</strong> ThisÂ layout should not be formal and all lined up like the Typography page. But if you have images and textboxes along the left-hand side of the page,Â align them.</p>
<p><strong>REPETITION:</strong> Make sure the distance between images and textboxes is consistent throughout the page.</p>
<p><strong>BALANCE:</strong> If you put all the images on the left and all the text on the right, your page will not be balanced. It will be too heavy on the left side. Make sure you balance the left and right, the top and the bottom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You will begin to learn how to Photoshop an image. On all of these assignments your grade will depend on making it look real!</p>
<p>First, go to pickupdropoff &gt; machtayh &gt; pickup folder. There is a folder called &#8220;cart1,&#8221; drag that folder into your documents folder. You will eventually make use of all the images inside cart1.</p>
<p>LASSO TOOL</p>
<p>Open the file img_windows.psd. You will use the Lasso Tool to cut out the insides of each of the windows. Make sure you SET FEATHER TO 1 (not 0). Nothing in real life is feathered at 0. Feathering at 0 makes a sharp, hard edge, that will not look realistic.</p>
<p>CLONE STAMP TOOL</p>
<p>Open the file img_courtyard.psd. You will use the Clone Stamp Tool to remove all the people from the image. Make sure you&#8217;re aware of where your Source is and where your Copy is.</p>
<p>IMAGINARY LANDSCAPE 600px wide by 400px ht. Hand in PSD.</p>
<p>You will combine three images together to create an Imaginary Landscape. One of the three images needs to come from the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p>You need to choose three different images that will match up. That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foreground/Mid-ground/Background: choose one picture that shows something close to the camera; one that is medium distance; one that is far away from the camera. There are some pictures that include close/medium/far in one photo (for instance an angled shot of Golden Gate Bridge). Don&#8217;t use pictures like that.</li>
<li>Same/Similar Lighting: you can&#8217;t combine a daytime image with nighttime image. Don&#8217;t choose an image with unusual lighting (an orange sunset).</li>
<li>Same Angle: some photos are taken looking down from a hilltop (or a helicopter), some are taken looking up at a tall building. You can&#8217;t easily combine those with other pictures.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t Try to Cut Our the Golden Gate Bridge: It can&#8217;t be done. Don&#8217;t try putting something behind the Golden Gate Bridge. It will look sloppy and phony. You can put the Bridge as the bottom layer/background. But nothing behind the bridge.</li>
</ul>
<p>TWINS PROJECT 600px wide by 400px ht, hand in PSD.</p>
<p>You will combine two photos of yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the angle is the same on both pictures</li>
<li>The lighting has to match (this won&#8217;t be a problem if you use two pictures both taken inside this classroom)</li>
<li>The larger person is in front. (It won&#8217;t look real if you break this rule.)</li>
<li>If you can create a story with your Twins picture, you&#8217;ll get extra credit.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week we considered how adjectives can be applied to design. The same describing words used forÂ a person, can also describe a design (professional, crazy, loud, quiet).</p>
<p>This week you&#8217;re going to make three banners,Â each of which displays your first name. Each banner will be 400 pixels wide by 200 pixels high. You will save each one as a JPG and place the three in a folder called 2lastnamenamebanners before putting them in dropoff folder.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will select one adjective that describes you. That adjective will be applied to the design of all three of your name banners.</li>
<li>First name only. You can use a nickname. No last names.</li>
<li>Each name banner should use different typefaces and different colors. But they should all reflect the same adjective.</li>
<li>You cannot use any images on your three banners. You can only use letters, shapes, colors and design to communicate your chosen adjective.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be creative. Have fun. Your completed folders are due one hour into block day this week.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week you learned to work withÂ basic Photoshop tools, how to insert an image into your Photoshop file, add type, and use Layer Styles and Filters. The class also looked at the way adjectives can be applied to design: Professional, Wild, Quiet, Loud.</p>
<h6>This week you will put all of that to use to create 3 GALILEO BANNERS, each one 400px w X 200px ht, saved as JPGs.</h6>
<ul>
<li>Each banner should use Galileo colors: Purple &amp; Gold or Purple &amp; Orange. You don&#8217;t have to use any specific Purple. In fact you&#8217;ll want to use different colors of Purple on the different banners.</li>
<li>Each banner will include the word GALILEO (or GALILEO ACADEMY or GALILEO ACADEMY OF SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY) with Layer Styles applied.</li>
<li>Each banner will include a photograph of a Lion with a Filter applied.</li>
</ul>
<h6>BANNER 1: FOOTBALL TEAM</h6>
<p>This should be bold and bright. Make a design that could be blown up super-large and serve as a banner in the stands at Kezar Stadium on Turkey Day.</p>
<h6>BANNER 2: PRINCIPAL&#8217;S BUSINESS CARD</h6>
<p>This should be very professional and business-like. The design mustÂ look serious, with any design elements neatly and carefully done. (Don&#8217;t include Principal&#8217;s name or school address, just the design with Lion and name of the school.)</p>
<h6>BANNER 3: WHAT YOU LIKE</h6>
<p>This must be for Galileo. It must use the colors and the lion, and have words on it. But it could be for a specific school club, or just a design that you like.</p>
<p>HAVE FUN WITH THIS!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
