				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Video Project must…</p>
<p><strong>HAVE MEANING:</strong> It should address an issue or concern. Viewers should be informed, educated or made aware of something, or – best of all – motivated to action because of your video. This doesn’t mean you have to hit people over the head with a message, and it doesn’t mean your video needs to be deadly serious. EXAMPLE: “A Girl Like Me” informed and educated; I didn’t know that African-American girls felt unattractive because of their skin color or hair texture.</p>
<p><strong>HAVE PASSION:</strong> The leader of the team should promote a topic that she/he feels passionate about. Other than making video what do you care about? EXAMPLE: Different students may be passionate about abandoned pets, or adding bike lanes to Polk Street, or preparing for a Robotics Competition.</p>
<p><strong>USE ONLY COPYRIGHT-FREE MATERIAL:</strong> Do not choose topics that would require use of copyrighted music or images or video. You can make use of work from Creative Commons (with proper attribution). EXAMPLE: This is why local topics are usually preferable to international issues. If you need B-roll of the crisis in Syria, it will likely be someone else’s copyrighted photos or video.</p>
<p><strong>BE LARGE ENOUGH:</strong> Is the plan for your video big enough to warrant having 3 or 4 students work for two months? EXAMPLE: You could videotape the Chinese New Year Parade and edit it in one or two weeks. How can you expand this project beyond just showing the parade?</p>
<p><strong>PRESENT CHALLENGES:</strong> You can request interviews with school board members or members of the board of supervisors. Most people are friendly and open to being interviewed by a video crew of high school students, even if you approach strangers on the street.  You may feel intimidated doing things like this – that’s all the more reason to do it! Challenge yourself and grow!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each team will make a video, 1-2 minutes long, on the topic &#8220;I feel connected to Galileo because of&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Choose one Galileo student. Have that student tell the story of something at this school that makes her/him feel connected. Maybe the student is part of the Futurama DJ Club. Maybe the student plays violin in the school orchestra. Maybe the student&#8217;s connection to Galileo is through JROTC or the Hospitality &amp; Tourism program. Maybe the student feels connected to Galileo because she eats lunch with her friends in Ms. Morrison&#8217;s classroom every day.</p>
<p>Record the student&#8217;s voice over.</p>
<p>Then get footage to illustrate what the student is talking about.</p>
<p>Completed videos due at the end of class Tuesday, October 27th.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two written assignments and a test that will count as one &#8220;assignment&#8221; for the second marking period grade.</p>
<h4>VISIONS OF LIGHT</h4>
<p>Those students who did not go on the field trip watched the movie &#8220;Visions of Light.&#8221; You were asked to write about two things you learned from this movie. Very few of you handed this in.</p>
<h4>ARISTOTLE &amp; THE MOVIES</h4>
<p>You learned about Aristotle&#8217;s Poetics and his principles of drama. You were asked to write about a movie you like and describe:</p>
<ul>
<li>How is the beginning something &#8220;you don&#8217;t need anything before this.&#8221;</li>
<li>How is the end something &#8220;you don&#8217;t need anything after this.&#8221;</li>
<li>Who/what is the protagonist.</li>
<li>Who/what is the antagonist.</li>
</ul>
<h4>WRITTEN TEST</h4>
<p>The written test will have essay questions about principles of editing you learned from the movie &#8220;The Cutting Edge.&#8221; Plus there will be some short answer questions about using Premiere Pro and the video equipment.</p>
<p>EDITING PRINCIPLES ON TEST</p>
<p>You should be able to explain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parallel Action (Edwin S. Porter)</li>
<li>Invisible Edit (D.W. Griffith)</li>
<li>Montage (Russian — Kuleshov, Eisenstein)</li>
<li>Classic Hollywood Edit (studio system, America 1930&#8217;s/40&#8217;s)</li>
<li>New Wave (France &amp; USA)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With your new team you will create a How-To Video.</p>
<p>It needs to be instructional and show a step-by-step process. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to cook something</li>
<li>How to build something</li>
<li>How to repair something</li>
<li>How to do a trick on a skateboard</li>
<li>How to put on make up</li>
<li>How to change a tire on a car</li>
<li>How to sew on a button (better be careful with focus on this one)</li>
</ul>
<p>Video should be 1-2 minutes long. Your video will be successful if a person could watch it and actually follow the steps, to able to learn from the video. (This is a BIG challenge and not easy to do!)</p>
<p>Start by writing a script. You could use a voice over or you could use words on the screen explaining the steps (or you could use both). Then plan a storyboard. What shots will you need to get to clearly show the steps in the process?</p>
<p>When you shoot, get multiple angles, multiple screen sizes, cutaways so you have footage to work with when you&#8217;re editing.</p>
<p>Due Tuesday, October 13th.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choose a storyline for your Metaphorical Montage. Then make a storyboard of what shots you need to get. You will be communicating visually.</p>
<h6>WHAT&#8217;S A METAPHORICAL MONTAGE?</h6>
<p>A Metaphorical Montage is used in movies to compress time.</p>
<p>The best example of Metaphorical Montage is early in the movie UP. We see all of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Fredricksen&#8217;s marriage in about 4 minutes. Each individual shot counts. Each individual shot tells a story, adds to the character development, shows the passage of time.</p>
<p>Watch the shots where the couple finds out they can&#8217;t have children. How do you know that&#8217;s an Ob-Gyn office? How do you know they&#8217;ve received sad news?</p>
<p>Watch what happens to the jar where they&#8217;re saving money for a trip to Paradise Falls. It starts to fill up and then there&#8217;s a flat tire. The jar is broken. It starts to fill up again. Then a branch falls on the roof. We don&#8217;t have a long dialogue scene where they talk about needing a new roof and how they&#8217;ll have to take the money from their dream trip! It&#8217;s short, efficient, and tells the story with visuals.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a series of shots showing Mr. Fredricksen putting on ties — the styles change, ties are wider, narrower, wilder patterns, finally a bow tie. There&#8217;s a scene where they&#8217;re going up a hill to a picnic. Ellie is first and her husband follows her. Then we see the same scene again years later. This time Ellie can&#8217;t make it to the top of the hill.</p>
<p>Metaphorical Montage can repeat scenes — each time with something changed to show that time has passed.</p>
<p>Metaphorical Montage relies on visual images that tell the story.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t make reference to suicide. Don&#8217;t show people starting physical fights. Don&#8217;t use language inappropriate for school. Show that bullying hurts people; bullying is a dumb, childish thing to do; and that standing up against bullying is a positive thing.</p>
<p>One interesting fact: 30% of kids who are bullies in school end up spending some time in jail as adults.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each team will make an Implied Action video.</p>
<p>Implied Action is what you see in a movie when an actor is supposedly hit by a truck. That actor did not actually get hit by a truck. The director planned out a series of shots to make you believe you saw the person getting hit.</p>
<p>You need to create a storyboard so you know what shots you need to get. The storyboard should show each camera shot planned out. You don&#8217;t need to be a great artist. Storyboard should show (1) size of character in screen, and (2) screen direction.</p>
<p>You need to use CLOSE UPS! Get in closer! Yes, CLOSER! You can&#8217;t create Implied Action in Medium Shots. And get sound effects. GarageBand has many sound effects. Or you can toss a backpack down a flight of steps and record that to try to emulate the sound of someone falling down steps.</p>
<p>ALSO — include a POV shot where the person is looking at something (but the thing they&#8217;re looking at is not really there). This is also Implied Action. You can video someone sitting the courtyard, show them looking at something, and edit to a shot of a football game on the field. The audience will believe that person in the courtyard is watching the football game.</p>
<p>DO NOT PUT ANY STUDENT IN DANGER!!! Nobody should be falling down any steps. The idea is to create the Implied Action without actually doing the real action.</p>
