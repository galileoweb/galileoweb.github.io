				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an event coming up at Galileo on May 8th: TeenTechSF.</p>
<p>Look over the information about the organization and the event here:</p>
<p>https://teentechsf.org/</p>
<p>https://www.facebook.com/teentechsf</p>
<p>https://www.eventbrite.com/e/teentechsfgalileo-diversity-fuels-innovation-registration-16494638909</p>
<p><strong>CREATIVE BRIEF</strong></p>
<p>Those students who went on our field trip to Walmart.com learned how to prepare a &#8220;Creative Brief.&#8221; Work together with your new teams. Use those same skills and put together a presentation about &#8220;How should we promote TeenTechSF at Galileo?&#8221;</p>
<p>Consider the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is our target audience?</li>
<li>Why would they be interested in attending this event? (What do they care about?)</li>
<li>How can we communicate? Posters? Announcements? G-House TV Commercials?</li>
</ul>
<p>Be prepared to present your ideas to the class on Tuesday.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each student will design Folder Covers for Galileo. Hand in what you have at the end of block day this week. You can make one, two, or three. But you must use the 3-1/2 hours of class time.</p>
<p>This is the one time we are using INCHES NOT PIXELS, and using a different pixels per inch setting.</p>
<p><strong>Each file will be 11 inches height by 8 inches width, 150 pixels per inch.</strong></p>
<p><strong>DO NOT SAVE-FOR-WEB AS JPG.</strong> (When you use &#8220;save for web&#8221; Photoshop changes pixels per inch to 72. You must keep 150 pixels per inch so there is higher quality for printing.) Use &#8220;Save As&#8221; and select JPG.</p>
<p><strong>Place in folder called 2lastnamegalfolder.</strong></p>
<p>Photos of Galileo can be found at pickupdropoff &gt; machtayh &gt; pickup &gt; any of the green folders (galpics09, galpics10, galstudents, etc.). You can also take your own photographs of Galileo. If you submit at least 8 usable, interesting Galileo pictures (different from the ones already in the folders) you will receive .1 extra credit on this grade.</p>
<p>SUGGESTIONS:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can write &#8220;Galileo Academy of Science &amp; Technology&#8221; or &#8220;Galileo Academy&#8221; or simply &#8220;Galileo.&#8221; Do NOT write &#8220;Galileo High School.&#8221; If you have multiple lines of text do NOT put them on one layer.</li>
<li>Use <strong>ALIGNMENT</strong> — if you&#8217;re making a  formal design with 4 small images stacked up, make sure the left and right margins of those images align.</li>
<li>Remember <strong>HIERARCHY</strong> — &#8220;Galileo&#8221; is the most important word on your folder cover. The least important word is &#8220;of.&#8221;</li>
<li>Be <strong>CREATIVE</strong> — make one simple, straightforward design. Then try something different and interesting for a second design.</li>
<li>Show <strong>PHOTOSHOP SKILLS</strong> — Use Layer Masks, Cut-Outs, Filters, Layer Styles; show what you know in Photoshop.</li>
<li><strong>USE THE CLASS TIME YOU&#8217;RE GIVEN</strong> — you have 3-1/2 hours! You may make one folder cover that is very complicated and intricate and takes the full time. Or you may make a design that is very simple and takes 20 minutes. Use your time well and make as many designs as you can between now and block day.</li>
</ul>
<p>DUE BLOCK DAY THIS WEEK.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This project is a bridge between the work you&#8217;ve been doing with graphic design and websites and the work you will do with video.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT STORYBOARDS</strong></p>
<p>On a professional movie a storyboard shows every shot. This is because shooting a movie is expensive. Most filmmakers can&#8217;t afford to make decisions as they go along. They need to plan in advance. By having a storyboard they know what the location is, who/what is in the frame, and the framing of the shot (close-up, medium, over-the-shoulder, wide shot, etc.).</p>
<p>You will generally create your storyboard by drawing with pen or pencil. You do not have to be a great artist to create a storyboard. There are two important things you need to show: Size of the Figures in the Shot; and Screen Direction. Mr. Machtay will show examples (<a href="https://www.machtay.com/lessons/camerashots.html" target="_blank">https://www.machtay.com/lessons/camerashots.html</a>).</p>
<p><strong>YOUR STORYBOARD ASSIGNMENT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to pickupdropoff &gt; machtayh &gt; pickup and get the file called storyboard.psd.</li>
<li>You will fill your storyboard file with images you find on the internet.</li>
<li>Create a story using 8 images. Re-size and crop the images so they fit within the 8 frames on the page.</li>
<li>NO WORDS! Mr. Machtay should be able to follow your story without reading any words.</li>
<li>Make sure your name is on the file.</li>
<li>When you are complete save your file as a JPG and put it in dropoff.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>STORYBOARD PART 2</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The class will form into 4 person teams.</li>
<li>You will work together with your teammates to create a storyboard for a short video.</li>
<li>This video will show someone going from one side of the courtyard to the other side. Something happens to that person as they head across the courtyard. Make it interesting.</li>
<li>You must include the following shots in your storyboard (as explained by Mr. Machtay):</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Wide Shot (establishing shot)</li>
<li>Medium Shot</li>
<li>Close-up</li>
<li>High Angle Shot</li>
<li>Low Angle Shot</li>
<li>Point of View (2 shots)</li>
<li>Pan</li>
<li>Tracking Shot</li>
</ul>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ms. Yalon from Career-Tech Ed office is coming to class on Monday to guide you in how to fill out a job application.</p>
<p>You need to prepare over the weekend and<br />
<strong>BRING THESE THINGS ON MONDAY:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bring a print out of your Resume! Print it on Friday if you need to. (We can&#8217;t waste class time on Monday having you all log in to print out your resumes.)</li>
<li>Bring Identification: Xeroxes of your social security card or birth certificate, driver&#8217;s license of California ID. Also a copy of your most recent (end of last semester) report card. You will need these points of identification for any internship or job.</li>
<li>Blue or black pen and a pencil for filling out the application.</li>
<li>Also have information about your references and their contact information. You cannot use parents or relatives for references. You can ask teachers or coaches (if they know you are responsible and hard working).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ESSAY PROMPTS FOR CTE INTERNSHIP APPLICATION</strong><br />
Write the following in a thoughtful manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>How has your high school experience prepared you for an internship? How will an internship support/help your learning? (300-500 words)</li>
<li>List the skills you think make you a great candidate for a summer internship. (Computer skills, interpersonal skills, foreign language)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MS. YALON&#8217;S VISIT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU!</strong> If you&#8217;re not prepared for this opportunity, that says a lot about whether you are prepared for an internship or a job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #993366"><strong>DUE FRIDAY, JANUARY 23: Photoshop JPG of website template, 1000px X 600px</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366"><strong>DUE MONDAY, JANURY 26: First Article for Website, first draft</strong></span></p>
<p>You will work on teams to create websites about your neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The target audience is teenagers — maybe these teenagers are visiting your part of the city or maybe they&#8217;ve just moved to your neighborhood. They want to know where to go and what to do. That could mean: a playground where they can get a pickup game of basketball; a hilltop that has great views; a neighborhood diner where they can get a low-cost breakfast sandwich; a street that has a lot of shops or beautifully-painted houses.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not writing this for tourists. You&#8217;re not writing this for rich people who have a lot of money to spend. A little bit of historical research might be interesting, but the focus is on INFORMATION and OPINIONS! If it&#8217;s a place to eat: How expensive is it, what&#8217;s good on the menu, what hours is it open, what Muni line could you take to get there, what&#8217;s special about this place?</p>
<p>Each student will write about two neighborhood places: a main article 200 words long, plus a sidebar for the article. (English Learner students will write one article instead of two.) Each team will be responsible for getting their own photos for all articles.</p>
<p>Each person on the team will have a job. There can be more than one person in a job. The jobs you need to fill are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PROJECT MANAGER:</strong> Keep track of what is complete and what still needs to be completed</li>
<li><strong>LEAD CODER:</strong> Responsible for HTML and CSS coding</li>
<li><strong>LEAD DESIGNER:</strong> Responsible for implementing design</li>
<li><strong>LEAD EDITOR:</strong> Responsible for reading and proofreading teammates&#8217; writing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On Wednesday,</strong> each team will submit a list of the articles — which student is writing about which place?</p>
<p><strong>On Friday,</strong> each individual student will submit a design for their website. What will the logo look like? Where will the words go? How large will the pictures be? Remember to design it so your site can easily be constructed using CSS-P.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The class will review the basic principles of an Ad Campaign. To be an Ad Campaign (and not just advertisements) your three ads should all use the same logo, same/similar slogan, similar images (same size, same filter or tint, similar type of image).</p>
<p>You will design three ads that go together in an ad campaign. Each ad will be <strong>400px wide by 600px height. Save as JPGs.</strong> Place in a folder called <strong>5lastnamesfads</strong>.</p>
<p>For San Francisco pictures go to: pickupdropoff &gt; machtayh &gt; pickup &gt; sfpics. You can also take your own photos this week. If you give Mr. Machtay 8 new photos that you took, that are good (focus, lighting) and can be added to the pickup folder, you will get a .1 bump in grade; for 12 or more pictures you will get a .2 bump.</p>
<p>See samples here <a href="https://machtay.com/lessons/sanfran/sampleads.html" target="_blank">https://machtay.com/lessons/sanfran/sampleads.html</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you advertise San Francisco?</li>
<li>How can you reach consumers who are teenagers living in the city? What will your ad look like? What will it say?</li>
<li>What features of the city/parts of the city/things about the city would you feature?</li>
<li>How can you make the city seem attractive and appealing?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your Customer (the people you want the ad to reach): Young San Francisco residents who don&#8217;t go out to see the sites of the city, who don&#8217;t enjoy how beautiful and special this city is.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each student will make a Flash animation 720px wide by 480px height, 30fps (frames per second), minimum 10 seconds (that would be 300 frames).</p>
<p>Choose an example of rude behavior, some issue around the city or around the school where you think people could be nicer. Show it in animation form.</p>
<p>If you need to use words to explain it, don&#8217;t use a lot of words. Keep it short. Remember, even the shortest phrase needs to be on the screen for 4 seconds (at 30fps that&#8217;s 120 frames).</p>
<p>At the end of your animation add the words &#8220;BE NICE.&#8221; (This also needs to be on the screen for 4 seconds.)</p>
<p>Mr. Machtay&#8217;s example: People who get on MUNI and stand in front of the door — even though they&#8217;re not getting off the bus for miles and even when the bus stops at a crowded stop and a lot of people need to get off and on.</p>
<p>Another Example: When a young person is sitting on the bus and does not give up his seat to an elderly woman.</p>
<p>A School Example: Students who throw their candy wrapper on the floor instead of bringing it to a trash can.</p>
<p><strong>Now come up with your own idea!</strong></p>
