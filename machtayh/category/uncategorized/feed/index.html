				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Great interactive field trip to Disney Museum. Students were given opportunities to collaborate on &#8220;Creative Problem Solving.&#8221; Very proud of our Media Arts students — fully engaged.</p>
<p>With the tour and the workshop filling two hours, the students had very little chance to see the museum exhibits. Just a few select items were highlighted. So I&#8217;m glad we made a full day of it. After lunch the students went back into the museum on their own. I was at the door of museum at the end of the school day to have them check out for the day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Work with the same team. Produce a video due by Thursday, October 1st, on the topic &#8220;I FEEL CONNECTED TO GALILEO BECAUSE OF&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>For some students, being part of JROTC makes them connected. For other students playing on the Soccer team or Wrestling team could be the connection. For some students it&#8217;s just eating lunch in a certain hallway with a certain group of friends.</p>
<p>This is going to be a personal video about one student&#8217;s experiences at Galileo. The easiest format would be to have a student speak a narration and then use it as a voice over: (&#8220;I feel connected to Galileo because of playing in the orchestra. When I first joined the orchestra, etc, etc&#8230;.) Then get footage to illustrate what that student is speaking about.</p>
<p>The finished video should be approx. 1 minute to 1-1/2 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When editing video in Premiere Pro begin by creating Folders in Workspace on a computer. (Certain computers will be assigned to 5th period, and others to 6th.)</p>
<p>Create a Project Folder with name of project (no spaces, no special characters). Make the name clear (e.g., foodfestNov15).</p>
<p>Inside this Folder create 4 Folders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project</li>
<li>Video</li>
<li>Audio</li>
<li>Stills</li>
</ul>
<p>Then set the User Preferences for Premiere Pro so that all the cache files, etc, are directed the correct Folder inside Workspace.</p>
<p>DO THIS EVERY TIME! DO THIS EVERY TIME! DO THIS EVERY TIME! PLEASE PLEASE DO THIS EVERY TIME! Don&#8217;t get sloppy about it.</p>
<p>You need to move all video into your newly-created &#8220;Video&#8221; Folder in your Project Folder. Please do this! If you drag your video clips directly into Premiere Pro it will work at first. But when you disconnect the device your video content will disappear.</p>
<p>TO UPLOAD VIDEO</p>
<ul>
<li>When you attach the camera to the computer, iPhoto will open. Import your clips into iPhoto. Select ONLY your clips (make sure you&#8217;re not importing everything on the camera).</li>
<li>Then drag the video clips into the Video folder that&#8217;s inside your Project folder.</li>
<li>Then, in Premiere Pro, drag the clips from that Video folder into the Media Browser.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last 10 years Galileo has been the only SFUSD school with a broadcast that includes both live and pre-taped portions.</p>
<p>This year we&#8217;re going to switch to a pre-taped broadcast. The goal is that each week&#8217;s broadcast would be available on the Galileoweb site as of Wednesday morning. Homeroom teachers can then choose to show the broadcast on Channel 72, as usual. Or to show it through a computer and projector.</p>
<p>The live broadcast will end with LIVE ANNOUNCEMENTS. We will switch to a live announcer for last minute announcements. Therefore we need a small crew in the Broadcast Room during homeroom.</p>
<p>MR. MACHTAY&#8217;S DECREE: 6TH PERIOD WILL BE IN CHARGE OF BROADCAST FALL SEMESTER. 5TH PERIOD WILL TAKE OVER SPRING SEMESTER.</p>
<p>We need segment producers and segment teams.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Team in charge of College &amp; Career, Scholarship &amp; Work opportunities.</li>
<li>A Team in charge of School Activities: ASB, Pep Rallies, Assemblies, etc.</li>
<li>A Team in charge of Athletics: Get the scores (and info about the game) each Monday morning. Keep track of upcoming games.</li>
<li>We need to talk about how to make each of these the best it can be. What else will we need for the broadcast?</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need students to take charge of:</p>
<p>Calendar Manager: Keep track of what events are coming up. One student should make sure there are commercials in advance of events. Another student should make sure that there&#8217;s someone from Media Arts scheduled to video the event.</p>
<p>Production Manager: Keep track of every school-related project from the time it&#8217;s in the camera until it is a finished video on Galileoweb. This student will maintain a spreadsheet of the work flow.</p>
<p>Equipment Manager: With two classes there are no extra cameras. Keep track of who is taking out a camera at the end of class. Each class has its own equipment room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On All assignments below, save final work as JPGs, begin names with 5lastname, and put into dropoff folder as per teacher&#8217;s instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment 1</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Use the basic skills the class learned in Photoshop to create three Galileo logos, each one 400px wide by 200px height.</p>
<ul>
<li>gallogo1 – banner for football team, big bold and attention-getting</li>
<li>gallogo2 – business card for principal, professional-looking, serious, classy</li>
<li>gallogo3 – logo for Galileo of your choice</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assignment 2</strong></p>
<p>Create 3 Name Logos, also 600px wide by 200px height. Select one adjective that describes you (quiet, silly, tall, cute) and create three designs displaying your first name – each design should reflect your adjective.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment 3</strong></p>
<p>You will create four files, each one 400 px by 400px. See assignment at <a href="http://galileoweb.org/machtayh/2012/03/02/design-with-type/" target="_blank">DESIGN WITH TYPE</a>. On each of these 400&#215;400 files you will create three logo designs for one of the schools listed.</p>
<p>See the link to sample school logos. In each case, be aware of the type of school and how the school wants to brand itself to the public. Your choice of typeface, color, design elements should communicate that branding.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For examples go to: <a href="https://www.machtay.com/designtype.html" target="_blank">www.machtay.com/designtype.html</a></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000">Save each logo as a GIF</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000">Place them in folder named 5lastnameschools.</span></p>
<p>ASSIGNMENT BELOW:</p>
<p>You have four different clients that need &#8220;Brand Identity&#8221; for their schools. Each wants to have a logo that reflects who they are. Remember, your design will have to work blown up very large on the front of the school building. It will also have to work in a small size on school gym shorts and polo shirts. (Choose 4 schools out of the 5 below.)</p>
<ul>
<li>You will create 3 logos for each of the 4 schools. This means a total of 12 logos.</li>
<li>Make a Photoshop file 400px x 400px for each of the schools. (You can add to length if your designs take up too much space.)</li>
<li>No pictures, but you can use shapes.</li>
<li>You are using TYPE to create the DESIGN (and the client identity).</li>
<li>Mr. Machtay will give lesson on LETTERSPACING (Kerning). Make sure you take care with spacing between letters.</li>
<li>Due Friday, April 27.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you get the full school names correct and that capital letters are used appropriately for&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SnobHaven Academy for Proper Young Ladies &amp; Gentlemen</strong><br />
Very expensive with a long history of spoiling the children of the ultra-rich. They want everyone to know that they have a lot of money.</li>
<li><strong>Frederick Douglass Bayview School</strong><br />
Progressive school formed by teachers who left the mainstream education system. This school teaches liberation and self-reliance, with student voices encouraged.</li>
<li><strong>Oldenburg Institute of Fashion &amp; Design</strong><br />
Very difficult to gain admission, a very prestigious school for young artists and designers. They need a graphic identity that will convey how impressive and artistic they are.</li>
<li><strong>Learn thru Play Pre-School</strong><br />
They want a graphic identity that is welcoming to parents and appealing to little children. Bright colors, playful shapes or letters would be appropriate.</li>
<li><strong>Einstein Science Institute</strong><br />
Students in this school take Calculus and Physics Freshman year and advance from there. Most graduates go to Stanford or Berkeley or MIT.</li>
</ul>
