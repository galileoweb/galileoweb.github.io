Juniors should be researching colleges NOW and thinking about what they want to write about in their personal statements. Start making drafts of essays! Everyone thinks, &#8220;Oh, I have these many months left, I can start later.&#8221; The time really flies by and it hits you at the very last minute that the applications are due. Also, there are a number of colleges that I wished I had applied to but I didn&#8217;t have time to because I found out about them too late into the application process. Also, I wish I could&#8217;ve spent more time on some of my applications because I realized that I really wanted to go to those schools but it was too late. So&#8230;.START NOOOOOW!!!&#8221; &#8211;Anonymous CA </span></address>

<p><strong>Andy Wong:</strong> As President of the Tech Club and the Robotics Team (ESM Robotics) here at Galileo, I&#8217;ve had the pleasure to be involved with a lot of tech activities, which will be sure to be a first-step into the engineering fields I wish to pursue in college. But I&#8217;m not just the tech-guy&#8211;as Vice President of the Debate Club, and member of the Social Awareness Club, I&#8217;m interested in vigorous discussion of the topics raging around in society today. And that&#8217;s really what I want to do with my life: to think critically, and to apply this thinking to our world today, whether with science, math, or simple reasoning. Other tidbits: Titanic, the Beatles, A History of Pi, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons are my favorite movie, band, book, and activity, respectively. Have fun on your college search!</p>

<p><strong>Benjamin Yin:</strong>  (Mechanical Engineering) Your buddy with many passions. Never fret approaching me, I&#8217;m almost always open for casual conversation or answering an informational inquiry. As a member of the mechanical engineering department in our school&#8217;s FIRST(For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) robotics team, motivated AP Physics AB &amp; Calculus student, as well as an active participant of various physics-oriented activities like ACE Architecture or Wonderfest, I have established a foothold in my path to becoming a freelance engineer. I like being an ambassador because this helps build my social skills in a work setting and mastering the etiquette at email communication. It also feels great to be an anchor for everyone in your grade. I applied to: UCSD, UCI, UCB, UCD, UCLA, CSULA, Cal Poly SLO and Pomona, SF State, and SJSU.</p>
<blockquote><address><span style="color: #333399"><strong>Benjamin&#8217;s advice about AP classes+internships+Senior year for Juniors:</strong> &#8220;You don&#8217;t NEED to take many APs in your senior year, but definitely invest in AP classes you think you&#8217;ll want credits for in college in order to skip some elementary classes or get ahead for your major. Be wary about the difficulty of the classes you sign up for. I&#8217;ve had friends drop out of AP Calculus or do terribly in the classes they signed up purely out of peer pressure. Do what your heart(and Bai + CA) tells you to, not what your friends are taking. If you don&#8217;t have the passion for the subject, you will not do well, and thus, risk being rescinded from your college acceptances. It&#8217;s OKAY to go undeclared, don&#8217;t let your family pressure you into a major as so many have in my grade. Relax about SATs not being good enough, you still have the first half of senior year to do them. Consider a subject SAT (2) NOW and start studying for it with the purchase/borrowing of a prep booklet. The summer after your junior year is super-important, use it to study for the SAT and get some programs/job experience in. JOBS/INTERNSHIPS actually look good on your college app! &#8220;</span></address>

<p><strong>Eric Chu: </strong>I&#8217;m an intrinsic writer. For me, writing is life. I am also a technophile, self-titled philosopher, poet, prose&#8230; artist? (prosetrist? poet is to poetry as prose is to what?), budding orator, and a proud proponent of universalist humanism. Meaning, I read widely in the literature of all religions, from Christianity to Satanism, and I believe that humanity is of prime importance&#8211;not any deity. Loves: People, literature, satire, debate. I can and will talk you to death. ;P. Hayao Miyazaki movies. The Legend of Zelda. Yiruma. Hates: Oily screens. Apathy. Intolerance. Any idea, religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual. (Totally stole that from Steinbeck). That feeling where you know you should be doing your work but then again that website is just so entertaining so you&#8217;ll spend maybe another a minute on it and then suddenly it&#8217;s 1 AM and your eyes are bloodshot and glazed and goddammit where did this jar of dirt come from. Aspirations: To be an English professor. To shape the world with my writing. To accrue enough monstrous arm strength so as to be able to perform ten push-ups.</p>
<blockquote><address><span style="color: #333399"><strong>Eric&#8217;s Tip for Juniors:</strong> Start researching early. It&#8217;s never too early to start thinking about what environment is right for you in a college, and never too early to start thinking of what you want to do with your life. Think. Reflect. Step outside of the boundaries of what your parents and family expect of you. Don&#8217;t let anyone come between the way of choosing what is best for your growth. It&#8217;s not your responsibility to hold yourself back for the sake of another. Know your options. Be organized. Put all your tax forms and whatnot in one place, digitally if possible. And most importantly, reach out for help! There&#8217;s so much free college help and resources out there.</span></address>

I suppose I should divulge in how this came to be: Grey&#8217;s Anatomy. This seems to be a romantic, childish interest, so I&#8217;m not sure of how valid and ardent this pursuit really is. Finally, something interesting about me is that I have a twin sister. Though, thankfully, she doesn&#8217;t attend this school. I speak English.

<p><strong>Ryan Choy:</strong> I transferred to Galileo in my Sophomore year and it was the best decision of my life. I spend most of my time hanging with friends and working out with the Galileo Dragonboat team, which I am captain of. I want to major in Biochem or Public Health Sciences at UC Irvine, and I want to become a nurse or radiation technician.</p>
<blockquote><address><span style="color: #333399"><strong>Ryan&#8217;s advice about starting early:</strong> &#8220;Finishing college application stuff early makes you look like a god among your peers. DO THINGS EARLY! It&#8217;s hard, and everyone says it, but I think every single senior wishes they started earlier.&#8221;</span></address>

<p><strong><span style="color: #333399"><span style="color: #000000">Shayla Averett:</span></span></strong>(Business/Communications) I am the president of the Black Student Union (BSU). Through high school, I&#8217;ve been on the girl&#8217;s basketball team, Drill Team, and Cheerleading Team. My current educational goal is to attend a 4 year university in the Fall 2013. Dreams: I want to travel to South Korea and learn the history and language of my culture. I always want to travel to other parts of the world like Brazil and Australia.</p>
<blockquote><address><span style="color: #333399"><em><strong>Shayla&#8217;s advice: </strong>Take the SAT/ACT; upcoming dates. The importance of taking the test. Explain the difference between the two tests. Apply for Questbridge and Summer Fun.</em></span></address>

<p><strong>Sidney Lin:</strong> Hi I&#8217;m Sidney! 😀 i&#8217;m involved with the Community Education Engagement at the Exploratorium. Been there for almost 6 years&#8211;Two as a student intern and four as a staff/facilitator. I&#8217;m currently undecided between what I want to pursue.</p>
<blockquote><address><span style="color: #333399"><strong>Sidney advice on SAT:</strong> Start on your SATs as early as you can! It helps to have a lot of time in between tests so you can improve your score better. Take SAT IIs even though they are not required for UCs. Many privates want two so it&#8217;s good to take it in the spring while the course information is still fresh inside your head!</span></address>

<p><strong>Stephanie Chan: </strong>(Undecided) I speak English and Cantonese. I applied to SFSU, SJSU, SDSU, CSULB, UCSD, UCI, UCSB, UCSC, Boston University, NYU, Brandeis, Mt. Holyoke, Smith College, Skidmore, Ithaca, University of Portland, Wesleyan.</p>
<p><strong>Tiffany Mach: </strong>(Marketing) I applied to UCI, UCSD, UCD, UOP, CSULB, SFSU, SJSU, SDSU, University of Portland, and USF.</p>
<p><strong>Tina Huang:</strong> I really like to do craft and work with tools, thus I discovered my future career choice. I want to be a dentist and possibly a dental surgeon.</p>
<blockquote><address><span style="color: #333399"><strong>Tina&#8217;s advice on SAT</strong>: I wish I started SAT/ACT preparation earlier, so that I could of known which test fits me.</span></address>

<p><strong>Willie Zuniga: </strong>My name is Willie Zuniga. I am a Co-Founder of the Galileo Technology Club and Galileo Debate Association as well as a leading member in the Galileo Social Awareness Club. I enjoy fiddling and tinkering with things; taking them apart to see how they work, and inspect what makes them tick. I am an avid fan of Legos &#8211; primarily their technic series. I like to work on computer hardware components and generally tinker with electronics. I am a huge listener of music &#8211; I do it all the time. I play the Violin and Guitar, and I am planning on learning the Piano very soon. Music is a huge part of my life. I am a big reader &#8211; I love reading; for multiple hours on end. I love thinking about literature, discussing literature, and everything about literature. I enjoy swimming &#8211; I am a certified Lifeguard. I want to pursue the study of Physics &#8211; I want to tinker with the Universe. I want to see how it works, why it works, and be witness to the fundamental properties and theorems that make our reality possible.</p>
<blockquote><address><span style="color: #333399"><strong>Willie&#8217;s advice about stress for Juniors:</strong> &#8220;I wish I would have known how stressful college apps were. I was told; but It didn&#8217;t really shock me into starting my apps early. Especially since I ended up writing 10+ essays for 12 private colleges.&#8221;</span></address>
