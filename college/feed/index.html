<h4>Galileo Academy of Science and Technology</h4>
<h2>MISSION STATEMENT:</h2>
<p>Since 1979, AACE Talent Search (AACE TS) has been funded by the U.S. Department of Education. AACE TS is a program that identifies, selects and assists low-income youth ages 11 and older that have the potential to be the first generation in their family to attend college. We support middle school and high school students to continue their education and encourage high school students and adults to enroll in a 4-year institution or postsecondary program.</p>
<p>AACE TS is committed to creating supportive relationships with students and providing safe environments for students to grow personally and academically.</p>
<h2><strong>OUR GOALS:</strong></h2>

<p>2 Serving all students without regard to race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender, religious creed, national origin, age and economic status.</p>
