						<p>School Site Council Meeting-May 20, 2009<br />
X  Agenda Attached<br />
X  Attendance/sign-in attached<br />
Present:  Ben Chun, Jonathan Ring, Bettie Grinnell, Mele Lau-Smith, Audrey Ricci, Leland Wong, Dominic Tsang, Samantha Lee<br />
Absent (Excused): Vicki Pesek, Stan DeBella, Doug Page, Kathleen Golata, Linda Liu, Jessica Wong,<br />
X  Minutes of the previous meetings approved </p>
<p>Decision Made/Issues Reviewed</p>
<p>I.  Call to Order<br />
	&#8211;B. Grinnell, SSC chair, called the meeting to order at 3:33 pm.  There were eight elected members present; a quorum was established.</p>
<p>II.  Approval of 4/15/2009 Meeting Minutes<br />
	&#8212; A. Ricci moved to approve the minutes as written.  M. Lau-Smith seconded the motion, and all voted in favor of approving the minutes.</p>
<p>III.  Principal’s Report<br />
	&#8212; V. Pesek was absent.  No report was presented.</p>
<p>IV.  Old Business<br />
1.  Approval of the Final Balanced Score Card (BSC)<br />
	&#8211;B. Chun commented that the BSC’s overall direction made a lot of sense.  Though it was a piece of paperwork, the content did reflect what the school was trying to accomplish.  He questioned the different roles on the Leadership Team as indicated in the Introduction paragraph.  He would like to know who defines the roles and the responsibilities associated with them.  He used himself as an example of the ambiguity; he was given the title as the Technology Coordinator, but the role was never clearly defined to him or the responsibilities.  He suggested a clearer job description to go with the job title, which implies certain responsibilities, and the scope of the role.<br />
	&#8211;J. Ring concurred that there are quite a few of these non-classroom titled roles.  He felt that there is a need for classroom teachers to help lower class sizes.<br />
	&#8211;One general comment was that the Introduction paragraph was vague about how involved the School Site Council was in writing the document or what further opportunity the students had in getting involved.  The District assumes that the SSC is heavily involved and that the BSC is driven by the SSC’s involvement.   B. Grinnell pointed out that though the SSC didn’t author the BSC document, but it was well conceived with the input of all the administrators and the leadership team.<br />
	&#8211;M. Lau-Smith had made some corrections and suggestions to the draft version, so she wondered if they had gotten incorporated into this final version.  She felt that this final version was a cleaner and more succinct document.<br />
	&#8211;B. Grinnell read the guidelines on the Recommendations and Assurances form, which the principal and SSC chair must sign to indicate their approval.  She asked the council if the school had met all the guidelines and they unanimously affirmed.  A. Ricci moved to approve the BSC as written and M. Lau-Smith seconded the motion.  All was in favor to approve the document.</p>
<p>V.  New Business<br />
1.  Prop H VAPA Budget Plans<br />
	&#8211;J. Taylor, VAPA department chair, read the department’s vision statement.  Then he went on to explain how the Prop H VAPA budget was allocated.  The amount of allocation per teacher was based on the number of sections taught.  Spending plans for each teacher was delineated on the handout.  He commented that the Prop H VAPA budget for 2009/2010 dwindled by 50% due to the cut back.  Regardless he appreciated getting the financial support to expand his department’s offerings.  One of the growing pains was that the pool of students was being pulled in all directions by the different classes available to them, causing them to go from one program to another.<br />
	&#8211;B. Chun commended J. Taylor for the organizational layout of the budget and the teachers’ spending plans.  J. Taylor felt that the budget needed to be transparent to avoid misappropriation of fund.<br />
	&#8211;D. Tsang questioned if the cost of printing the school newspaper in colors went up and who financed the paper.  J. Taylor clarified that the paper was financed by fundraising, advertisement income, and GAA’s donations.  As a member of the VAPA department, M. Huynh could also tap into his Prop H budget allocation to cover some of the operational expenses.<br />
	&#8211;B. Chun moved to approve the Prop H VAPA budget as submitted, and J. Ring seconded the motion.  All was in favor to approve the plan.</p>
<p>2. EIA/LEP Budget Plans<br />
	&#8211;K. Golata could not attend the SSC meeting because of her commitment to the Latino assembly; therefore, K. Lau substituted and presented the EIA/LEP budget plans instead.<br />
	&#8211;K. Lau passed out the 2009/2010 LEP preliminary budget handout, and went over each line item of the non-personnel object codes.  To begin with, the ELD department had received $105,949 in 2008/2009 and $100,659 in 2009/2010.  Because the new school year’s allocation was very similar to last year’s, each object code received the same percentage of appropriation.  K. Lau also detailed the department’s plan for each object code, i.e., technology proposal for the $47,036 equipment allocation-headsets with microphones, digital cameras, video cameras, laptops for students, interactive white boards, microphones for recording and pod casting, document cameras, DynEd licensing. </p>
<p>3.  Instructional Calendar Proposals for 2010/2011<br />
	&#8211;The District is considering restructuring the instructional calendar to be effective in the fall of 2010.  At a principals’ meeting, principals were presented with the two drafts of the instructional calendar and were asked to vote on one.  The major differences between the two versions:  1.  First day of instruction-A, on Monday, August 16; B, on Wednesday, August 18; 2.  End of fall semester-A, on Friday, December 17; B, on Wednesday, December 22; 3.  Winter break-A, from December 20-31; B, from December 23 to January 3; and 4.  Number of instructional days-A, 84 days in Fall/96 in Spring; B, 85 in Fall/95 in Spring.  The last day of instruction for both versions ends on the same day-Friday, May 27, before the Memorial Day holiday.  Majority of the principals didn’t like either of the versions; therefore, they voted both of them down.<br />
	&#8211;V. Pesek couldn’t be at the site council meeting because she was required to be at a scholarship awards dinner.  She wanted the council members to be aware of the two drafts and have a discussion about them.  K. Lau felt that having the fall semester wrapped up before the winter break could be beneficial; students would take the fall finals before they went away for a two-week break, allowing them to start afresh when they return for the spring semester.  B. Chun pointed out that teachers would lose two weeks of summer break during the transitional year, and they would not be compensated.  J. Ring questioned the discrepancy between the instructional days for the fall and spring semesters for both versions (84 vs. 96 days and 85 vs. 95 days).  Other than this discrepancy, he preferred draft A.   It was commented that due to the budget crisis, the governor had proposed to reduce the instructional calendar by 7 days.  Members didn’t understand how that could work because the teachers’ contract dictated a certain number of workdays.  It was unanimous that the council members would support the principals’ decisions and turn down both versions as well. </p>
<p>VI.  Open Forum<br />
	&#8211;M. Lau-Smith thanked the people who had attended the historical baseball championship game (held at the AT&amp;T ballpark) between Galileo and Washington.  Galileo had lot more attendees than Washington High School and we were better behaved!!  Although Galileo lost to Washington, but the athletes played a good game; they should be proud of their sportsmanship!   </p>
<p>D. Tsang moved to adjourn.  S. Lee seconded the motion and the meeting was adjourned at 4:45 pm.</p>
