<p>School Site Council Meeting-February 11, 2009<br />
X  Agenda Attached<br />
X  Attendance/sign-in attached<br />
Present:  Vicki Pesek, Ben Chun, Doug Page, Bettie Grinnell, Mele Lau-Smith, Audrey Ricci, Linda Liu, Dominic Tsang, Samantha Lee, Karin Lau, Charles Dixon;<br />
Absent (Excused):  Stan DeBella, Jonathan Ring, Leland Wong, Kathleen Golata, Jessica Wong<br />
X  Minutes of previous meeting approved.</p>
<p>Decision Made/Issues Reviewed</p>
<p>I.  Call to Order<br />
&#8211;B. Grinnell, SSC chair, called the meeting to order at 3:33 pm.  K. Lau introduced C. Dixon, who will serve on the School Advisory Committee, which advises the site council about the SCE program and its budget.</p>
<p>II.  Approval of 2/11/2009 Meeting Minutes<br />
&#8211;Members had been given an e-copy prior to the meeting.   M. Lau moved to approve the minutes; D. Page seconded the motion.  All nine elected members voted to accept the minutes as written.</p>
<p>III.  Principal’s Report<br />
&#8211;The contract to run the JROTC program in some high schools will expire soon and Fiona Ma has introduced legislation to keep the program alive.  Our Board is opposed to the program even though parents have shown strong support.  SFUSD students cannot receive PE credits.  Other Districts, like San Diego USD, grant PE or band credits.<br />
&#8211;JROTC has always occupied two classrooms-Rooms 156 and 157.  Although the construction projects yielded more classrooms and computer labs, nonetheless, space is still at a premium.  The administration is considering converting Room 156 into a general education classroom and having the JROTC program using Room 157 only.   The JROTC program is popular, but it currently does not have enough students to warrant it taking up two classrooms.<br />
&#8211;When Room 156 becomes a classroom, it will free up Room 458 to become what it has originally designed to be—a computer lab.  It is also more cost effective to convert Room 458 into a computer lab because it has the infrastructure set-up already.  B. Chun agrees that having a permanent computer lab verse a portable one is more time efficient; it eliminates the cumbersomeness of setting up and taking down the mobile lab.<br />
&#8211;D. Page wonders if the school gets more utility in using Room 458 as a classroom or as a computer lab.  There are currently 5 teachers who don’t have their own classrooms and have to travel (to no more than 3 rooms).  Yet, according to V. Pesek, there are many teachers who want accessibility to a computer lab.<br />
&#8211;D. Tsang proposes that the JROTC program keep both of the rooms; one to use as a classroom and the other as a locker room.  He further explains that due to the nature of the program, there is a plethora of bulky equipment, which requires a lot of storage space.<br />
&#8211;At the present time, there are more itinerant math teachers.  If a math class goes into Room 156, the teacher may be willing to allow the JROTC students to access the room after school and/or on the weekends.<br />
&#8211;One way or another, a decision needs to be made soon because of the source of the money for the conversion, which will be this new SCE fund.  M. Lau feels that the site council can formulate a room utilization policy to which the administration can refer.  As for the immediate action, the site council will ask the school administration to look at all the room usage equitably.<br />
&#8211;V. Pesek took the site council’s recommendation and increased the projected enrollment for 2009/2010 by another 150 to 2175.</p>
<p>IV.  Old Business<br />
1.  Balanced Scorecard/Strategic Plan<br />
&#8211;The draft version of the BSC was submitted on January 30, 2009.  The final version will be due in April.  That will provide the District ample opportunities to evaluate all the schools’ submissions.  The District personnel will color-code their comments:  yellow means a “wow” reaction and pink indicates a “what are you thinking?” response.<br />
&#8211;A hard copy of the BSC was distributed to all the members, who were requested by Z. Duskin to review and comment on the handout and return to her on the March 11 SSC meeting.  She will then incorporate all of the suggestions into the final version.</p>
<p>V.  New Business<br />
1.  Approval of the 07/08 EIA/SCE Carryover Budget<br />
&#8211;The pink budget set-up worksheet was distributed to all the site council members.  B. Chun explained that the worksheet was the District’s template, which separated the expenditures by object codes:  the one thousand series are for personnel expenses; the three thousand series are for benefits; the four thousand for supplies and materials; and so forth.  The amounts allocated per object code series had been determined by the team.  The bulk of the budget went to equipment.  The hand-written figures were the adjusted amounts after the Accounting department had loaded the budget and rectified any discrepancies.<br />
&#8211;The white budget worksheet was distributed to the council members.  It delineated the projects, budgeted amounts, actual costs, remaining amounts, and comments.  It was noted that the fund could only buy equipment but not pay for labor cost, which could come out of the site budget.  Therefore, these projects’ operational start-date should commence in the fall of 2009.<br />
&#8211;$11,580 went to pay for Ben Borrelli’s additional 2 classes in the spring semester.<br />
&#8211;$25,000 was allocated to pay Susan English-James for her consultancy in the spring semester.  She will be the Intervention Specialist to case-managed at-risk students.<br />
&#8211;$5,000 would go to Doug Kern for his consultancy in the Environmental Science Pathway program.<br />
&#8211;$45,000 was allocated for network closet upgrades.  The school network uses fiber-optic to connect the computers.  The system is old and needs to be replaced with a conversion to wireless capability.<br />
&#8211;$84,000 was allocated for the school-wide wireless network.  The goal is to install access points throughout the school so all the classrooms will have wireless capability.  There are 20 to 40 connections at each access point.   D. Page questioned if $84,000 was too much to spend on some equipment, which would become out-dated rapidly.  B. Chun clarified that products that come with a high price tag usually are high quality and one with support services.  The device B. Chun was contemplating was the Cisco 802.<br />
&#8211;$35,000 was allocated to transform Room 458 to a computer lab.<br />
&#8211;$35,000 was allocated to upgrade all the existing computer units in Room 260.<br />
&#8211;$25,000 was allocated to upgrade all the existing computer units in Room 101.<br />
&#8211;If all the replaced computers are still serviceable, they will be installed in the classrooms for students to use.  If they are too old, they will be delisted from the District’s inventory and will be disposed of properly.<br />
&#8211;$30,000 was allocated to purchase a mobile lab with lab books for the science department to do science experiments.<br />
&#8211;$30,000 was allocated to purchase a mobile lab with lab books, which will be available for any teacher to check out.<br />
&#8211;$4,335 was allocated to pay for a one-year subscription fee for a software program, which can detect plagiarism on students’ on-line submissions.<br />
&#8211;$2,000 was allocated to purchase a unit of Polycom Phone, which will allow conference call capability.  The unit is transportable.<br />
&#8211;$165,000 was allocated to purchase teacher laptops, LCD projectors, and interactive whiteboards.  M. Bush will work with department heads via a survey form to determine teachers’ needs and preferences.  This amount includes purchasing the hardware and providing teachers the training.  The goal is to provide a laptop for every teacher and a LCD projector in every classroom.<br />
&#8211;$6,000 was earmarked for students’ extra-curricular activities.  Studies have shown that when students are engaged in constructive school activities, they tend to do better academically.<br />
&#8211;$45,000 was allocated for curriculum development extended hours.<br />
&#8211;$40,000 was allocated for travel and conferences.<br />
&#8211;Curriculum Extensions, Curriculum Dev. Extended Hour/Conferences:  objectives are included in the SCE addendum.  Handouts were provided to members to read through, review, and comments:<br />
&#8211;Understanding By Design, a format selected by the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD) as the most proven tool for promoting coherence, relevance, and rigor through effective instruction.  To put it succinctly, it is when teachers start by planning the end result and work backward, covering all the goals/ activities/ concepts along the way.<br />
&#8211;D. Page asked how many teachers could the school send and stay within the budget.  Z. Duskin was developing the selection process and its objectives and would be able to present them at the next site council meeting.<br />
The important thing was for whoever attends these conferences to come back and share any newly acquired ideas with the other teachers.  He also commented that more of this money could be transferred to equipment or to something more tangible.<br />
&#8211;M. Lau agreed totally on allocating the bulk of the SCE money to build up the infrastructure of the school to provide for more resources and training on using technology in the classroom, which should enhance the learning experience of the EDY students as well as the general population.  However, she also suggested that some of this fund could be used to provide more training to students in using computer technology and for providing access to computers to those who might not have it at home.  She questioned how the school could involve the students in the planning process.  She wondered if the school could conduct focus groups or triads or surveys to ask students what their needs were in terms of accessing technology resources, what types of teaching methods (including homework and grading policies) worked well for them, and what activities would keep them more engaged, etc.  The findings should complement the teacher-training component.<br />
&#8211;D. Page brought up the guidelines on compensating teachers for their involvement in different projects.  He commented that many teachers did volunteer their time for different projects, but were not necessarily compensated.  The school should look at ways to compensate teachers equitably and maybe the site council could come up with some ideas on establishing the guidelines.  B. Chun further explained that some projects had the funding viability and were more time consuming and required more job details.<br />
&#8211;M. Lau proposed to modify one particular point in the second paragraph of the addendum.  The third sentence should be deleted and replaced with “The income and ethnic diversity of the student body enriches the school community and environment.  Additionally, the faculty considers providing resources to those educationally disadvantaged students a high priority so that all students have equal access to academic success.”<br />
&#8211;A. Ricci moved to approve the SCE Addendum to the Academic Plan Addendum with the motion to amend the second paragraph as proposed by M. Lau.  M. Lau seconded the motion.  All nine elected members voted to approve the SCE Addendum.</p>
<p>VI.  Open Forum<br />
&#8211;Majority of teachers prefer the 7-minute passing period versus the old 5-minute one.<br />
&#8211;The District is currently paying for the 7th PE teacher, Ms. Ramos, and will continue to do next school year.<br />
&#8211;The SF Ed Fund will pilot a program at Galileo.  They will hire someone to coordinate all the services that provide support for students to get into colleges.</p>
<p>&#8211;D. Page moved to adjourn the meeting; D. Tsang seconded the motion, and the meeting was adjourned at 5:32 pm.</p>
